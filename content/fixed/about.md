Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Scott Lowe, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

## Personal Information

I live with my wife, Crystal, and our kids in the Denver, CO area. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I'm enjoying the outdoor life or working in our church.

## Professional Information

I've been in the Information Technology field for more than 25 years, starting out in an entry-level desktop support role. Along the way, I've worked in a variety of roles---including (among others) as an instructor, technical trainer, systems administrator, IT manager, systems engineer, consultant, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for a small start-up, practice lead for a national VAR's VMware practice, and as a technologist. I've worked for a variety of companies, both large and small, including EMC Corporation (acquired by Dell Technologies), Nicira (acquired by [VMware][8]), VMware (acquired by Broadcom), Heptio (acquired by VMware), [Kong][6], and [Pulumi][9]. In the past, I also operated my own small consulting business.

Currently, I work for [Isovalent][10] (now part of [Cisco Systems][11]) in a customer-facing role. In my role, I'm focused on helping customers understand how to use and how to be successful with projects like [Cilium][12], [Tetragon][13], and others.

In addition, I am a former contributor to [SearchVMware.com][1], a VMware-focused website with technical articles, how-to's, tips, and news. I also had some articles published on [SearchServerVirtualization.com][2] and I am a former columnist for [Virtualization Review][3] magazine.

I currently have eight traditionally published books to my credit:

* *Mastering VMware vSphere 4*, published around VMworld 2009
* *VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference* (with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson), published in late 2009
* *VMware vSphere Design* (with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing), published in March 2011
* *Mastering VMware vSphere 5*, published in October 2011
* *VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition* (with Forbes Guthrie), published in March 2013 with updated content for vSphere 5.1 and vCloud Director
* *Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5* (with Nick Marshall, who took over other books in this series), published in November 2013
* *Network Programmability and Automation* (with Jason Edelman and Matt Oswalt), published in March 2018
* *Network Programmability and Automation, 2nd Edition* (with Jason Edelman, Matt Oswalt, and Christian Adell), published in August 2023

Some of these books are available from Amazon.com and other major booksellers, although many of the older books may no longer be available.

In the summer of 2014, I collaborated with a number of others to produce a book titled *OpenStack Architecture Design Guide*. This book is available online [via the OpenStack web site][5], but it is no longer being updated for more recent releases of OpenStack.

If you'd like more information, my LinkedIn profile is available [here][4], and my GitHub profile is available [here][7].
