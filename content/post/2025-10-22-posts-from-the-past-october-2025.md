Every now and then, I publish one of these "Posts from the Past" articles that looks back on content I've created and posted over the life of this site. This year marks **20 years** of content---I can hardly believe it! Don't worry, though; you won't have to go through 20 years of past posts. Here is a selection of posts from mid- to late October over the last decade or so. I hope you find something useful, informative, or at least entertaining!<!--more-->

## October 2024

Last year I shared information on [how to use Pulumi to stand up an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with Bottlerocket OS on the Kubernetes nodes][link-1]---without using any higher-level Pulumi components.

## October 2022

In 2022, after getting irritated with what I felt was a poor user experience when accessing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters created with Pulumi, I published this post on [how to change the Kubeconfig file for a more streamlined user experience][link-2].

## October 2021

[Cluster API][link-3] is the name of the game for multiple posts in October 2021. First I wrote this article on [`kustomize` transformer configurations for Cluster API v1beta1][link-4] (so that you can use `kustomize` to manipulate Cluster API manifests), followed up later that month with an article on [influencing Cluster API AMI selection][link-5].

I also touched upon [using the external (out of tree) cloud provider for AWS][link-6] that month, a topic I am revisiting soon as I explore integrating Talos Linux with AWS.

## October 2020

More Cluster API content---this time discussing [IaC considerations for Cluster API][link-7] (think things like integrating workload clusters with existing AWS workloads or services).

## October 2019

In October 2019 I explored [using `jk` to programmatically create Kubernetes][link-8] manifests, and discussed [how to use `kustomize` with `kubeadm` configuration files][link-9].

## October 2018

Plenty of articles discuss the use of `kubeadm` to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters (including a few I wrote!), but what of talking about [using `kubeadm` to stand up an etcd cluster][link-10]? I've got you covered!

## October 2017

Let's get recursive: check out this ["Posts from the Past" article from October 2017][link-11]!

## October 2016

Amid a bunch of content related to Vagrant, I found this gem on [using Ansible to manage your AWS infrastructure][link-12].

## October 2015

Flashing back an entire decade, the OpenStack Summit was happening in Tokyo, Japan, and I was liveblogging sessions. Among the sessions I attended and liveblogged was a session on Carina, a containers-as-a-service offering. Read [my liveblog of the Carina session][link-13].
