[Markdown][link-2] is a core part of many of my workflows. For quite a while, I've used Fletcher Penny's MultiMarkdown processor (available on [GitHub][link-1]) on my various systems. Fletcher offers binary builds for Windows and macOS, but not a Linux binary. Three years ago, I wrote a post on [how to compile MultiMarkdown 6 for a Fedora-based system][xref-1]. In this post, I'll share how to compile it on an Ubuntu-based system.<!--more-->

Just as in the Fedora post, I used [Vagrant][link-3] with the Libvirt provider to spin up a temporary build VM.

In this clean build VM, I perform the following steps to build a `multimarkdown` binary:

1. Install the necessary packages with this command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install gcc make cmake git build-essential
    ```

2. Clone the source code repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-6
    ```

3. Switch into the directory where the repository was cloned and run these commands to build the binary:

    ```bash
    make
    cd build
    make
    ```

4. Once the second `make` command is done, you're left with a `multimarkdown` binary. Copy that to the host system (`scp` works fine). Use `vagrant destroy` to clean up the temporary build VM once you've copied the binary to your host system.

And with that, you're good to go!
