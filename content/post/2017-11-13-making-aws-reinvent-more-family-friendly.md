[AWS re:Invent][link-2] is just around the corner, and [Spousetivities][link-4] will be there to help bring a new level of family friendliness to the event. If you're thinking of bringing a spouse, partner, or significant other with you to Las Vegas, I'd encourage you to strongly consider getting him or her involved in Spousetivities.<!--more-->

Want a sneak peek at what's planned? Have a look:

* Monday's activity is a full-day trip to Death Valley, including a stop at Bad Water Basin (significant because it is 280 feet below sea level, making it the lowest place in the Western Hemisphere!). Lunch is included, of course.
* On Tuesday, Spousetivities participants will get to visit a number of locations on the Las Vegas Strip, including Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden, the Wildlife Habitat at the Flamingo, and the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. Transportion is provided for longer connections, but there will be some walking involved---wear comfortable shoes!
* Wednesday includes a visit to Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam. There will some opportunities for short sightseeing walks in Red Rock Canyon (plus the 13-mile scenic drive), and the Hoover Dam tour includes access to the generator room (a very cool sight).
* Wrapping up the week on Thursday is a helicopter tour with views of the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, Fortification Hill, the Colorado River, and---of course---the Grand Canyon! This includes a landing on the floor of the Grand Canyon for a snack and beverages. This is an amazing experience. (I've personally taken this tour and it is _fabulous._)

[Registration is open right now][link-1], so sign up before it's too late. Prices for these activities is reduced from standard retail rates thanks to sponsorship from [VMware NSX][link-3].
