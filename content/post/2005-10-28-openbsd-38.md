It's hard to believe that I've been posting articles here for this long, but it's time for another release of [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/). As I've mentioned here before, I do use OpenBSD for a few purposes on my network, and I'm confident that OpenBSD 3.8, due November 1, will find its way onto the network as well. (It's fairly likely it will quickly replace OpenBSD 3.7.)

You know you are a true geek when you start measuring time in OpenBSD releases ("I've had this for over 8 OpenBSD releases!")

As usual, the OpenBSD web site has more information on ordering CD-ROMs or T-shirts to help support the project.

If you like using Unix-like operating systems (like Linux), then you should try OpenBSD.
