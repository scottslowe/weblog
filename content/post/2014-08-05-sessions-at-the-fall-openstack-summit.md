It's that time again---time for community voting on sessions for the fall OpenStack Summit, being held in Paris this year in early November. I wanted to take a moment and share some of the sessions in which I'm involved and/or that I think might be useful. It would be great if you could take a moment to add your votes for the sessions.

## My Sessions

I have a total of four session proposals submitted this year:

* [MIT and VMware: Taking IT to OpenStack Private Cloud](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/mit-and-vmware-taking-it-to-openstack-private-cloud)

* [OpenStack for VMware Operators](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/openstack-for-vmware-operators)

* [OpenStack Design Guide Panel](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/panel-with-the-authors-of-the-openstack-design-guide)

* [Panel: Tips and Tools for Building a Successful OpenStack Group](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/panel-tips-and-tools-for-building-a-successful-openstack-group)

## Congress Sessions

You may also be aware that I am involved with a project called Congress, which aims to bring an overarching policy service to OpenStack. Here are some sessions pertaining to Congress:

* [Congress: Policy as a Service](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/congress-policy-as-a-service)

* [Policy and Security in the "Goldilocks" Zone](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/policy-and-security-in-the-goldilocks-zone)

## VMware Sessions

Arvind Soni, one of the product managers for OpenStack at VMware, kindly pulled together [this list of VMware-related sessions](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/openstack/blog/2014/08/04/voting-for-openstack-paris-summit-talks), so feel free to have a look at any of these and vote on what sounds appealing to you.

## Other Sessions

There are _way_ too many sessions to list all the interesting ones, but here are a few that caught my eye:

* [Container Unification with libcontainer](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/container-unification-with-libcontainer)

* [Orchestrating Docker with OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/orchestrating-docker-with-openstack)

* [Building the Cloud Ecosystem - OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/building-the-cloud-ecosystem-openstack-docker-kubernetes)

* [New platforms with Open vSwitch: Docker, Hyper-V, and Intel DPDK](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/new-platforms-with-open-vswitch-docker-hyper-v-and-intel-dpdk) _(this is also listed on the VMware sessions above, but as you can tell it's really not a "VMware" talk)_

* [Deploying and Auto-Scaling Applications on OpenStack with Heat](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/deploying-and-auto-scaling-applications-on-openshift-with-heat)

* [Under the Hood: Libvirt/KVM Driver Juno Update](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/libvirt-driver-update)

* [Under the Hood with Nova, Libvirt, and KVM, Part 2](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/under-the-hood-with-nova-libvirt-and-kvm-part-two) _(coincidentally, not related to the previous session)_

* [Designate: An Overview of OpenStack DNSaaS](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/Presentation/designate-an-overview-of-openstack-dnsaas)

There are a bunch more that looked interesting to me, but I'll skip listing them all here---just hop over to the OpenStack site and vote for the sessions you want to see.
