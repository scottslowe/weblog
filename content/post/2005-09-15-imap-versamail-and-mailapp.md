I'm continuing to experiment with [VersaMail](http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/versamail.epl), the e-mail application running on my [palmOne Treo 650 smartphone](http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/). GPRS quibbles aside, my only complaint is related to the interactions between VersaMail and [Mail.app](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/).

Specifically, when I delete a message in VersaMail (and tell VersaMail to delete the message on the server), it doesn't always disappear in Mail.app. Likewise, when I delete a message in Mail.app, it remains in the Treo's Inbox. Even using the Treo's "Sync server folders" command in VersaMail doesn't seem to correct the problem.

I'm sure that this is all just the result of slightly differing IMAP implementations. After all, I have seen firsthand how deleting an e-mail message in Mail.app doesn't "take effect" in Outlook until you switch folders in Mail.app. Sometimes you have to use the "Empty Trash" command as well in order for changes to take effect.

It's certainly not a showstopper, so I'm not terribly concerned about it. But, if someone has some information on how I might be able to work around this, that would be greatly appreciated.
