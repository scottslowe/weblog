A few days ago I mentioned [Kubuntu 5.10][xref-1]. [Kubuntu][2] is the [KDE][3]-based variant of [Ubuntu][4]. After having installed and used Kubuntu, I decided to try Ubuntu, the [GNOME][5]-based cousin. I downloaded the ISO image of the install CD last night and installed it today while reviewing HSRP configurations for an upcoming Cisco installation.

I am equally as pleased with Ubuntu as with Kubuntu. I find that version 2.12 of GNOME, which ships with Ubuntu, is much better than the older versions of GNOME that I had used. In addition, the overall fit and finish of the distribution is very good, and I continue to enjoy using `apt-get` to update and upgrade packages on the system. As a matter of fact, the only downside to either distribution so far is that Kubuntu doesn't include [Firefox][6] by default (note that Firefox is included with Ubuntu).

So, I currently have two older Compaq Armada E500 laptops that I've loaded with Linux---one is running Kubuntu, and the other is running Ubuntu. Both work flawlessly, including full interoperability with my wireless network.
