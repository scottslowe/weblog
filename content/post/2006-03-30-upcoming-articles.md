Due to some of the work I'm being asked to do at the office, there should be some very cool informational articles headed this way. Here's a quick look at what I hope to provide in the next few weeks.

Pretty quick off the bat will be an informational article on [Windows Server 2003 R2](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx), which I'll be installing in my test lab in the next couple of days. The focus will be on key differences between Windows Server 2003 and R2, with a particular focus on the integration of UNIX interoperability tools. I hope to be able to provide an updated set of guidelines on [Linux-AD integration][1] based on R2 very soon.

I also hope to be able to provide more details on [VMware ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/esx/), which is the underlying technology for my test lab at the office. I would _love_ to get in on the beta for ESX 3/VC 2, but don't know that I'll get that opportunity. In particular, I'd really like to test the VLAN/port group functionality in ESX Server and its interoperability with [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/) VLANs. I have some Cisco experts working with me at the office, so I think it might happen.

Along the same lines, I'm going to try a migration of a VM from GSX Server/Workstation to ESX Server as well, so I'll post some information on that process.

Finally (as if everything else wasn't enough), I'm hoping to get to delve into [Citrix Presentation Server](http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186&ntref=PROHOME_ProductsBar), which I haven't had the opportunity to work with in a couple of software revisions (not since it was MetaFrame XP). Citrix has good technology, and I'm anxious to see the changes since I last worked with the product.

If anyone has anything specific they'd like to see me touch on, drop me a line via e-mail or add some comments. I can't guarantee I'll be able to get you the information you're seeking, but I do promise to try.
