Some time ago, I noticed while using my [Treo 650](http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/) that I could not perform a HotSync operation via [Bluetooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) while I had a [GPRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS) connection active. As if that wasn't enough, I've discovered what appears to be a further incompatibility between these two wireless technologies.

It appears as if anytime I use Bluetooth on the Treo 650 for anything other than communicating with my wireless headset (a [Motorola HS850](http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&SiteID=motostor&Locale=en_US&Env=BASE&productID=36061500)), I am unable to establish a GPRS connection. I get an error (the exact text varies) whenever I try to establish the GPRS connection.

I've reviewed all the various settings on the Treo, but I don't see anything that needs to be changed to fix this. This is terribly irritating, since I'd really like to be able to wirelessly HotSync my Treo to my [PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) while I am away from the office without having to give up my data access via GPRS.
