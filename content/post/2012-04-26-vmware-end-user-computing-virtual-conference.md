>Please join VMware as we discuss the next step forward in end-user computing for the post-PC era.

>The VMware End-User Computing Team

The virtual conference is next Thursday, May 3, from 8:30 AM Pacific Time until 1:30 PM Pacific Time. If you're interested in end-user computing, it might be worth your time to tune in and see what VMware has to share. (I don't have any inside knowledge on exactly what's being shared.)
