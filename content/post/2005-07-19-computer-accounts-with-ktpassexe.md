As a quick follow-up to my previous posting, testing with Kerberos authentication from a Linux server with pam_krb5 was successful. Instead of using a user account in Active Directory to generate the keytab, I was able to use a computer account and just had to modify the `ktpass.exe` command line syntax slightly (see [my previous post][xref-1]).
