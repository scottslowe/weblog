What is [PuppetConf 2013](http://puppetconf.com)? PuppetConf is the annual operations conference hosted by [Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com). This year the conference is in San Francisco on August 22 and 23, and will be focusing on the themes of cloud automation, DevOps, and continuous delivery. All in all, it looks to be quite an interesting event.

If you're interested in going to PuppetConf 2013, then you might be in luck. **I've managed to score a pair of tickets to PuppetConf 2013 that I can give away, 1 each to 2 lucky readers.** Note that these tickets _only_ cover the cost of the conference, a $995 value ($750 if you consider early bird pricing); you'll still need to cover your own travel and other expenses.

If you'd like to enter to win one of the two free conference tickets, just submit a comment below. Be sure to use a valid e-mail address when submitting your comment, because I'll notify the winners via e-mail. Also, note that all comments are moderated, so your submitted comment might not appear immediately (I'll do my best to moderate comments quickly). I'll select two winners at random at noon MDT this Friday, July 19 from among all submitted comments.

Good luck!
