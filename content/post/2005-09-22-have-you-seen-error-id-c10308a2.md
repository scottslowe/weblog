As the next-to-last article in a series of postings about the problem described in this [KB article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809), it appears that Microsoft will not be producing a hotfix for this bug. In speaking with Microsoft earlier today, it appears that no hotfix will be produced for this, even though it is a confirmed bug. As of this afternoon, the only known fix for the problem is using **both** methods outlined in the KB article. I hope to confirm that for sure on Monday.

I'm also going to confirm on Monday whether membership in the local Administrators group (on the actual Exchange servers) will also fix the issue.

The next posting about this problem will be the last one regarding this issue. Really.
