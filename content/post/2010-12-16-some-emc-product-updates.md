There have been a few important EMC product updates over the last few days that I thought I might highlight here real quick:

* Replication Manager has been bumped up to version 5.3.1 (also referred to as 5.3 SP1), which adds several new features. One of the more notable features is the ability to do file-level restores from both VMFS and NFS datastores. Other new features include the ability to create SnapView snaps or clones from RecoverPoint targets and expanded host and application support.

* EMC has released the Virtual Storage Integrator (VSI) 4.0 for VMware vSphere. This is a new release, with new functionality, of our previous generation vCenter plug-in. This new release offers comprehensive discovery and mapping of storage resources, including support for discovery and mapping of VPLEX devices; a single vCenter interface for EMC storage devices of all types; centralized monitoring and control of host-based path management (both PP/VE and NMP); and expanded storage provisioning support from within vCenter Server.

* EMC also released a new version of the Site Recovery Manager SRA for SRDF. Co-worker Itzik Reich has a great write-up of [the new features of the SRDF SRA](http://itzikr.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/new-emc-srdf-sra-for-srm-get-the-scoop-inside-2/) on his blog.

If PowerLink has not already been updated with information on these new releases, those updates should happen very soon so check PowerLink for more details. Thanks!
