Taken from [this Dark Reading article](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=104271&f_src=darkreading_section_318), here are a few ways to protect yourself from the VML vulnerability:

* Unregister the VML DLL (`VGX.DLL`, found in `Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared`) using `regsvr32.exe`.

* Apply a restrictive access control list (ACL) to the VGX.DLL file. [This weblog entry](http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2006/09/19/Block-VML-Zero_2D00_Day-Vuln-on-a-domain.aspx) shows how to help automate this using Group Policy for larger organizations (very handy!).

* Disable "Binary and Script Behaviors" in Internet Explorer 6. Unfortunately, this measure may only be temporary, as the exploit is moving beyond its original JavaScript-based incarnation (see below).

* Switch to an alternate browser or use a virtual browser appliance.

In case you're wondering why it might be important to protect yourself against this vulnerability, take a look at this article describing the [scope of the attacks](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=104273&f_src=darkreading_section_318). As many as 10,000 web sites could end up hosting exploit code to take advantage of this vulnerability, and researchers are predicting that an e-mail variation may soon follow.

Enterprises that don't want to deploy Group Policy but still want to protect themselves against the vulnerability can use WMIC to remotely run the `regsvr32.exe` command against remote computers. Of course, this disables VML functionality, but how many enterprises out there actually _use_ VML? Here's the general command:

    wmic /node:<PC name> process call create 
    'regsvr32.exe /u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\VGX.DLL"'

As I've mentioned before, you could substitute a text file for the PC name above and WMIC will iterate through the list, performing the same task on each PC in the list. To re-enable VML functionality, you could use the same process but remove the "/u" switch from the `regsvr32.exe` command.
