Congratulations are in order for virtualization security company HyTrust, who within the last few days has had a flurry of activity. I've met HyTrust's CEO several times (he's a great guy, by the way) and I've followed the company since their early days; personally, I think it's great that they're seeing some success.

The first big piece of news was that HyTrust hired Jim Gannon, a former VMware executive, to serve as the VP of Sales. The full press release for that announcement is [here](http://www.hytrust.com/company/press-release-20100223-jim-gannon).

The second big piece of news comes in the form of [this press release](http://www.hytrust.com/company/press-release-20100224-funding) announcing that HyTrust has secured $10.5 million in Series B financing, including an investment from Cisco Systems.

The third and final piece of news, and the one that I personally find most exciting, is that HyTrust has been named one of ten finalists for the "Most Innovative Company at RSA Conference 2010" award. Congratulations on all three counts!
