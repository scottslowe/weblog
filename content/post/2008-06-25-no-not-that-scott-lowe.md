I suppose it was bound to happen at some point.

I've been confused for the _other_ Scott Lowe. Yes, that's right; there's more than one.

The _other_ Scott Lowe writes for TechRepublic.com, and currently works for either Elmira College or Westminster College; I'm not sure which. (I've seen both; I think it's Westminster.) He's published a couple of books, including one on Exchange Server 2007 that was published by Microsoft Press, and owns the slowe.com domain.

Normally, being mistaken for the _other_ Scott Lowe wouldn't be a problem; he seems like a smart, well-respected, knowledgeable guy. In this case, though, it was some business contacts at NetApp that picked up [this article](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/datacenter/?p=380) in which Scott Lowe purchased an EMC storage array. Clearly you can see where that would cause some confusion.

So, just to set the record straight: I didn't purchase an EMC storage array. Nor did I purchase a Dell M1000e blade chassis. I also don't know anything about open source IP telephony. Sorry. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with any of these products; it just wasn't me. I _do_ have a copy of the aforementioned Exchange Server 2007 book; but it's not my name on the front cover, unfortunately.

I hope this helps to clear things up. However, if you've accidentally mistaken me for him, and you'd rather read his stuff, [this TechRepublic.com search](http://search.techrepublic.com.com/index.php?t=0&s=0&o=1&q=scott+lowe) should help you out.

Now, back to looking at my Toshiba CIX1200 phone system. Oh, wait---that wasn't me, either...
