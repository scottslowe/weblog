I received a copy of the new album by Casting Crowns today, _Lifesong_. There are a couple of really good tracks, like the title track "Lifesong," and "Father, Spirit, Jesus", and "Set Me Free." Most of the songs, though, are a very different style than Casting Crowns' debut album. To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. After so thoroughly enjoying their first CD, I was really looking forward to their next album.

This is not to say that the CD is bad. It just wasn't what I had expected. Songs from their first album really moved you, like "Voice of Truth", "Who Am I", "American Dream", and "If We Are The Body". And they did so with a powerful rock sound. These songs, on the other hand, are much softer. The lyrics are good, but the musical style is not what I was hoping for.

Then again, a few of the tracks from the original album didn't really strike me the first time I heard them, but as I listened to them again I began to enjoy them more. Perhaps the same will happen here.
