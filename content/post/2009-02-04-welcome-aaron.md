I'm very excited to announce that we'll be adding content from a new author very shortly. Who is this new author, you might ask? Fellow ePlus colleague and engineer extraordinaire Aaron Delp has agreed to begin contributing content here on my site!

Some of you may know Aaron from his own blog, [BladeVault.info](http://www.bladevault.info/), which he established about a year ago. If you haven't [already heard](http://www.bladevault.info/2009/02/04/change-in-plans/), Aaron has decided that he'd rather focus on sharing information instead of worrying about blog administration. He's moving most of his content over to [a new location](http://blog.aarondelp.com), but has also agreed to share new content here with this audience. Since his areas of expertise dovetail nicely into the kinds of things I cover here, I think this is an excellent fit. I couldn't be more thrilled.

Aaron's first article is already in the works; in fact, it may even hit the site tonight after this post goes live. Stay tuned---we've got some great stuff in store!
