I love DVDs. Ever since I bought my surround sound system around Christmas of 2000, I have preferred DVDs over VHS for any new movies that we purchase. The big problem, though, is that DVDs aren't nearly as durable as videotapes, and in a family with kids that's a big deal. I have younger kids, and it doesn't take much for a kid to scratch a DVD when putting it into or taking it out of the DVD player. All it takes is one scratch and that's pretty much the end of that movie.

Even before I switched to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), I have been making digital copies of every CD that I purchase, so that I can quickly and easily make another copy in the event that the original CD gets damaged in any way. The introduction of [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) and my [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) have made this easier. I hadn't considered, even with the introduction of the 5th generation iPod with video capabilities, that I could do the same with my DVDs until just the other day.

So I set out to see if it was possible to do the same with my DVDs. I'd researched this a little bit earlier, so I already knew about [MacTheRipper](http://www.losprimates.net/mtr/) (MTR), a program for extracting the digital video from a DVD. I used MTR to extract the video for _I, Robot_ to an external FireWire hard drive attached to my [PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/). That process went well, didn't take too terribly long, and the resulting VIDEO_TS folder created by MTR worked flawlessly using [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/). I then turned to a program called [DVD Imager](http://lonestar.utsa.edu/llee/applescript/dvdimager.html), which is designed to turn a VIDEO_TS folder into a DVD image that can be burned to a DVD. The problem, however, was that the VIDEO_TS folder and the resulting DVD image were 6.87GB in size. As a result, I was not able to burn the image back to a standard DVD-R using my PowerBook's SuperDrive.

I tried another DVD (_Robots_ this time) and ended up with 4.62GB of data. OK, I thought, a single-layer DVD holds 4.7GB of data so I should be fine. Wrong! That didn't work, either.

That means I'm currently stumped as to the next step. A number of online searches have turned up recommendations for [Popcorn](http://www.roxio.com/en/products/popcorn/) (from [Roxio](http://www.roxio.com/)), but I'm trying to see if I can avoid having to purchase software and instead make do with freeware and/or open source applications.
