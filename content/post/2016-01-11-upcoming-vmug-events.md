I'm extremely honored to have the opportunity to help support VMware User Group (VMUG) meetings all over the world. I will be speaking at a few upcoming events; if you're going to be at one of these events, I'd love to meet you, say hi, and chat for a bit. Here are the details.

**Tuesday, February 23, 2016**  
I'm really excited to be back in Sydney again for an opportunity to speak at the Sydney VMUG UserCon (see [the event page][link-1] for full details).

**Thursday, February 25, 2016**  
Two days after the Sydney event I'll be in Melbourne to help support the Melbourne VMUG UserCon. (More details [here][link-2].)

**First week in March 2016**  
The dates for these events are still being finalized (I'll update this post when I have more details), but I'll be in South Africa for a series of VMUG events there as well (Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town). This will be my first time in South Africa, and I'm really looking forward to meeting and talking with customers there.

Aside from these VMUG events, if you're in one of these regions, are a current (or potential) customer of VMware, and you'd like to meet to talk about NSX, please let me know. I'd love to meet with you while I'm in the area!
