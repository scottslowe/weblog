In case you hadn't already heard, this past Tuesday, July 24, Train Signal officially released my [Designing VMware Infrastructure video training course](http://www.trainsignal.com/Designing-VMware-Infrastructure.aspx)!

If you're interested, you can [view a sample video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESF6-t3D_iQ&feature=plcp) from the course on YouTube.

This is my first video training course, and I'm really excited to see it officially released. I hope that the video training course is as helpful to users as my books (like [_Mastering VMware vSphere 5_](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470890800/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343598584&sr=8-1&keywords=mastering+vmware+vSphere+5) or [_VMware vSphere Design_](http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Design-Forbes-Guthrie/dp/0470922028/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343598617&sr=8-1&keywords=vmware+vSphere+design), written with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing) have been. Having now done both books and video training, it's interesting to me how very different the two media are, and how very different the content creation process is. It was a learning experience for me, and I'm looking forward to more video training courses in the future. If you have any specific things for which you'd like to see video training courses produced, let me know by speaking up in the comments below. Also, if you have the Designing VMware Infrastructure course, I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement!
