title: 'Technology Short Take 112'

Welcome to Technology Short Take #112! It's been quite a while since the last one, as life and work have been keeping me busy. I have, however, finally managed to pull together this list of links and articles from around the Internet, and I hope that something I've included here proves useful to readers.<!--more-->

## Networking

* [Part 2][link-13] of Stark and Wayne's container-to-container networking for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes digs deep into CNI workings.
* Via Ivan Pepelnjak's site, Albert Siersema shares some information on using Ansible to [automate 802.1x configurations][link-24].
* Milind Gunjan shares some [tips for troubleshooting Linux bridged networking on a KVM host][link-28].

## Servers/Hardware

Nothing this time around! I'll stay alert for content I can include next time.

## Security

* Tim Hinrichs discusses [securing the Kubernetes API with Open Policy Agent][link-4].
* Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are an important security feature in Kubernetes. Sysdig [explains][link-2] PSPs, and talks about `kube-psp-advisor`, a tool to help simplify deploying PSPs.
* [ClusterScope][link-3] is a handy tool for finding outdated images in your Kubernetes cluster.
* [This article][link-12] discusses four open source secrets management tools.
* Many organizations prefer to use two-factor authentication (2FA) to help protect their systems. While this article on [how to configure 2FA for SSH on Fedora][link-11] probably won't work in many corporate environments (few use Fedora), it may provide enough information to figure out what it would look like in your environment.

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Bahubali (Bill) Shetti walks through [analyzing the cost of a self-managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS using VMware CloudHealth][link-1].
* Ahmet Alp Balkan does [a deep dive on the KUBECONFIG file][link-17].
* Lee Briggs writes about [his experience with Fargate][link-9]. I think the key takeaway here is that prior experience _always_ affects our perceptions and how we go about learning new technologies/acquiring new skills. My prior experience with hypervisors (vSphere, then KVM) affected how I learned Docker and containers. Lee's prior experience with Kubernetes affected how he learned Fargate. Someone who'd worked quite a bit with Fargate would probably have a hard time switching to Kubernetes. An individual's learning curve is strongly dictated by previous experience and knowledge.
* Ernese Norelus has [an introductory piece][link-26] on using Terraform and Ansible to enable repeatable infrastructure builds on AWS.
* Fernand Galiana [introduces Popeye][link-27], a tool for finding and identifying misconfigurations in your Kubernetes cluster. I haven't had the chance to give it a try yet, but it looks pretty interesting.
* Aeva talks a bit about [what happened to OpenStack][link-30]. Key excerpt (for me) from this article was this statement: "...creating a viable, open source, hyperscale cloud software solution was against the best interest of the companies most heavily investing in OpenStackâ€™s development."

## Operating Systems/Applications

* Brian Christner talks about [becoming a Docker "power user" with VS Code][link-19].
* John Harris explains [how to use dynamic configuration discovery in Grafana][link-18].
* Matthias Eisner has written an article on [custom XML objects in vRealize Orchestrator][link-22].
* Tonis Tiigi has a write-up on [experimenting with rootless Docker][link-10] over on the Docker Engineering blog. Pay close attention to the current caveats---some of them are significant (there's a reason this is still experimental).
* I loved [this "quick tip"][link-8] on setting the default format for commands like `docker ps`. Very handy!
* There are some useful Bash tips [here][link-25].
* Mark Church from Docker provides [an update on Windows containers with Docker and Kubernetes][link-29], specifically calling out the support for Windows node as of the Kubernetes 1.14 release. Here's [Microsoft's side][link-31] of the same announcement.

## Storage

Nothing this time. Have something you think I should share here? Let [me know on Twitter][link-99].

## Virtualization

* Larry Smith Jr. [shares some information][link-21] learned in building nested ESXi templates.

## Career/Soft Skills

* [This blog post][link-20] from XMind has some nice tips on staying focused in the workspace.
* I really enjoyed [this discussion][link-23] on deep work and real-time collaboration. Cal's book is in the "To Read" pile on my desk; guess I need to hurry up and get to it!

That's all for now---stay tuned for future Tech Short Takes, as I'm striving to be more regular with publishing them. In the meantime, feel free to [contact me on Twitter][link-99] with any comments, suggestions, corrections, or other feedback.
