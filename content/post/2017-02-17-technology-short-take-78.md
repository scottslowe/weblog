title: 'Technology Short Take #78'

Welcome to Technology Short Take #78! Here's another collection of links and articles from around the Internet discussing various data center-focused technologies.

## Networking

* The rise of the disaggregated network operating system (NOS) marches on: this time, it's Big Switch Networks [announcing expanded hardware support in Open Network Linux (ONL)][link-9], upon which its own NOS is based.
* The Pivotal Engineering blog has [an article][link-20] that shows how to use BOSH with the vSphere CPI to automate adding servers to an NSX load balancing pool.
* Mircea Ulinic has a nice article describing [the combination of NAPALM and Salt for network automation][link-21].
* Here's a post by Ron Fuller on [changing the IP address of NSX Manager][link-32].

## Servers/Hardware

Nothing this time around, sorry!

## Security

* As part of some research around my Linux migration, I came across this write-up on [how to do encrypted instant messaging on OS X with Adium and Off the Record (OTR)][link-5]. I've been using OTR with Adium for a while so this wasn't new to me, but I wanted to share it here for others who may not be familiar with the solution. (I use OTR with Adium on OS X, and OTR with [Pidgin][link-6] on my Fedora Linux laptop.)
* Along the same lines as the previous bullet, here's a write-up on [how to encrypt your e-mails with PGP keys][link-7]. Now, PGP keys have been around forever, but the cool part (IMO) about this write-up is integrating [Keybase][link-8] (and PGP keys generated in Keybase) into the process.
* Docker Inc. (the company) has recently announced they've [added secrets management into Docker Datacenter][link-13]. The New Stack has [a decent analysis][link-14] of this latest move and the potential impact it will have on the container ecosystem.
* Humair Ahmed takes a closer look at [some Cross-VC NSX security enhancements][link-19] that landed in the recent NSX 6.3 release.
* This is an older article, but I don't think I've mentioned it before now. [This article][link-24] discusses the virtual machine introspection (VMI) functionality introduced in XenServer 7 while illustrating the value of hypervisor-based security controls.

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Ryan Kelly has a whole collection of posts about the Puppet plugin for vRealize Automation (vRealize Orchestrator, actually). First, he shares [how to install and configure the Puppet plugin for vRealize Automation][link-10]. This enables you to automatically install the Puppet agent and make it active when you deploy a VM via vRealize Automation. (More information on the Puppet plugin is available [here][link-11].) Next, Ryan shares [how to integrate the Puppet plugin into vRA blueprints][link-16]. Finally, he has a couple of troubleshooting articles, one on [a potential gotcha when upgrading the plugin][link-17] and another [when getting an error on workflows][link-18]. There's lots of good information here.
* Adrian Roberts shares a walkthrough of [running Photon OS and VMware Admiral in a vCloud Air Network environment][link-12].
* How about a new [Clarity][link-27]-based interface for vRA 7.2? [Check this out.][link-28] (Note: This is _totally_ unsupported. You've been warned.)

## Operating Systems/Applications

* Daniel Allen Deutsch extolls the benefits of [learning to use tmux properly][link-1].
* Here's a piece by Carla Schroder on [third-party repositories for CentOS][link-15].
* I mentioned Flatpak (in the last Technology Short Take, I believe) recently. Here's a note mentioning that [new Firefox builds][link-25] and [the Telegram client][link-26] are available via Flatpak.
* Kudos to GitLab for [their detailed and transparent post-mortem][link-30] of the recent database outage. There are lots of lessons that can be learned from this information.

## Storage

* Anthony Spiteri [discusses an issue][link-4] he saw with his new SuperMicro-based home lab; apparently there's a problem with the native VMware driver that causes slow performance.
* Cormac Hogan has a brief update on [storage options for containers on VMware][link-29].
* Check out [Aaron Patten's article][link-31] on vRA + SPBM (storage policy-based management) with VVols.

## Virtualization

* Via one of the OpenStack mailing lists, I saw a reference this article article by CERN regarding their use of [NUMA and CPU pinning for high-throughput workloads][link-2]. While discussed in an OpenStack context, the focus of the article is more on KVM's functionality.
* Here's another virtualization-focused article written in the context of an OpenStack environment, this time focusing on [performance comparisons between Hyper-V and KVM][link-3].
* William Lam has an update on [the 7th-generation Intel NUC and ESXi 6.x][link-22]. Check it out if you're considering the latest Intel NUC for your home lab.

## Career/Soft Skills

* Communicating effectively is an important skill, and communicating effectively via e-mail is an especially important skill. Check out this HBR article on [making sure your e-mails give the right impression][link-23]. (Thanks to Jonathan Gershater for the link.)

That's all for this time, folks. Hopefully something I included here was useful to you, or made you think. Have a great weekend!
