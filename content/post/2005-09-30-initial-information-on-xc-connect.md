As you may recall, the idea behind [XC Connect](http://www.xcnetwork.com/) is that multiple applications across platforms could synchronize data with each other. This would make it possible, for example, for a list of Contacts normally managed inside Outlook to also be shared seamlessly with Linux systems running Evolution and Mac OS X clients running iCal. This synchronization would also be possible, in an encrypted fashion, across the Internet.

Tests of Windows-to-Windows synchronization are very positive. The but the real test for me is synchronizing between iCal/Address Book and Outlook. If that part works as well as what I've seen thus far, I will be **truly** excited. The idea of having a single list of contacts is more enticing than perhaps I can fully elaborate.

I plan on performing some additional tests this weekend, and when those tests are complete I'll post more information here.

Then all I have to do is figure out why my Treo won't synchronize fully with my laptop.
