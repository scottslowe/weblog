Shamelessly copied (mostly) from both [Yellow Bricks](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/06/12/vmworld-2009-ta2259-ask-the-experts-panel-session/) and [VMwareTips.com](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/06/12/vmworld-2009-ta2259-ask-the-experts-panel-session/). I didn't think either Duncan or Rick would mind very much.

I am proud to officially announce the VMworld 2009 - Ask the Experts Panel Session. This session will feature virtualization experts Rick Scherer, Scott Lowe, Duncan Epping, Chad Sakac and Tom Howarth answering your questions on virtual infrastructure design. In the next week or so we will be posting sections on our blog sites for you to submit questions for review during the session, so stay tuned!
