Last week I was invited to speak at a joint session of the East Tennessee VMware and EMC user groups in Knoxville. Despite some bad weather that kept some people from attending, the meeting was a great success. I'm posting a copy here, via [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/), of the presentation that I used for that meeting. Note that the actual presentation had some embedded videos in it that SlideShare won't translate; these appear as blank slides.

Here is [a link to the presentation][1].

I hope you enjoy it and find it informative!

Questions, suggestions, and clarifications are always welcome! Feel free to speak up in the comments.

**UPDATE:** In the blog migration at the end of 2014, presentations from SlideShare that had been embedded in blog articles were converted to links.
