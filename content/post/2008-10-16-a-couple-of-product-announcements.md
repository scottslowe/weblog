I don't generally post lots of product announcements because I'm just too busy to keep up with everything that's happening. (Either that, or I'm too lazy. Take your pick.) However, there are a couple of announcements that passed through my Inbox this week that I thought I'd share here.

First, the folks over at VKernel have released the Capacity Analyzer 2.0 product. I [spoke with the VKernel team][1] back during VMworld and I like what I've seen of their products. Even if you don't think you need a capacity management tool, have a look at this product anyway.

Second, Altor Networks---of whom I wrote [here][2] regarding their VNSA---has released the Altor Networks VF (Virtual Firewall). This product builds upon the functionality of the VNSA to add policy enforcement, i.e., the ability to block traffic. I've had the beta running in my lab for some time now, and it's pretty interesting. I'm a bit miffed that the Altor folks didn't give me a heads-up on the release before it happened, but I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.

I just wanted to point out those new product releases. Oh, and along the lines of new products, I'm also working on some more in-depth information on Hyper9's search-based management product and application virtualization from Xenocode. Stay tuned.
