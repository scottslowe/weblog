title: Installing Ansible 2.2 on Fedora 25
url: /2016/11/25/installing-ansible-fedora-25/
---

As part of my ongoing investigation of the usability of various Linux distributions and desktop environments, I've been working with [Fedora 25][link-1]. As part of the investigation I need to see how to perform certain tasks, one of which is working with [Ansible][link-2]. As a result, I needed to install Ansible 2.2 on Fedora 25, and it turns out it wasn't as simple as `pip install ansible`.

I generally prefer to run Ansible in a [Python virtualenv][link-3], but I don't believe that it will make any difference to this procedure. However, I'm happy to be corrected if someone knows otherwise.

To create a Python virtualenv, you'll first need virtualenv installed. I prefer to install virtualenv globally for all users using this command:

```sh
sudo -H pip install virtualenv
```

Once virtualenv is installed, then create a virtualenv for Ansible:

```sh
virtualenv ~/Envs ansible
```

Then activate the virtualenv:

```sh
source ~/Envs/ansible/bin/activate
```

At this point, you can try a `pip install ansible`, but it will fail. First, you need to install some additional development libraries that are required in order to install Ansible:

```sh
sudo dnf install libffi-devel redhat-rpm-config python-devel openssl-devel
```

Once those packages are installed, _then_ you're finally ready to install Ansible into the virtualenv:

```sh
pip install ansible
```

(Note that `sudo` is _not_ used here because you are installing Ansible into your own virtual environment.)

That's it---you're now ready to roll. Enjoy!
