So my wife has been working on some options for spouse (non-conference attending partner) activities while in Las Vegas. I originally mentioned this [here][1], and John T. at VMware was kind enough to [mention it again](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2008/07/vmworld-early-b.html) as well.

Here are a couple of the options that we're currently tossing around:

1. Purchase the Las Vegas PowerPass, which grants access to a bunch of different Las Vegas attractions. You can get more information about the PowerPass at [www.visiticket.com](http://www.visiticket.com). Also available from the same site is information on the Las Vegas MealTicket. Prices range from $75 (for one day) to $145 (for five days). Crystal is only planning activities for a couple of days during the conference, but attendees may want to buy a longer PowerPass for activities before or after VMworld.

2. Instead of the PowerPass, we could arrange for a private tour of Hoover Dam or a private trip to the Grand Canyon. This approach could only accommodate groups of up to 9, and would range in price from $119 to $139. There may be some additional charges for transportation; we're still working on this option.

3. There are a lot of free (or inexpensive) attractions in Las Vegas, so the third option would be to simply arrange an itinerary based on these activities. This would include stuff like going to the Mirage to see the white tiger exhibit or taking the gondola ride at the Venetian.

So what Crystal needs now is some feedback from readers and readers' spouses as to what direction best suits them. Which of these options is the most attractive? Or would something else entirely, like shopping and getting a pedicure and manicure be better? Any feedback and direction that you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
