Last week I had the opportunity to speak to the Toronto VMUG and present an updated version of my talk on considerations for building stretched vSphere clusters. Stretched clusters are a topic I've touched on several times, first [in Denver in June 2010][1], again [this past May in Charlotte][2], and finally in Toronto last week. Last week's presentation, found [here][3], includes new and updated content for vSphere 5.

As usual, feel free to speak up with any comments, suggestions, clarifications, or corrections. Thanks, and I hope you find this useful!

**UPDATE:** During the blog migration in late 2014, embedded presentations were converted to linked presentations.
