Technically, Independence Day in the US isn't until tomorrow (July 4). I don't plan on being around much tomorrow, though, so I'm posting this today.

As you celebrate July 4th this year (or, for our international readers, whenever you celebrate your country's independence day), be sure to remember the other kind of independence that was made possible only through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While the United States achieved independence in the physical world 230 years ago, many people are still bound in a life of dependence upon material things---money, lust, cars, houses, prestige---the list is endless. Is this 4th of July time to achieve a new independence?
