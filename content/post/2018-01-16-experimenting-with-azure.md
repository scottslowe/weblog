I've been experimenting with [Microsoft Azure][link-4] recently, and I thought it might be useful to share a quick post on using some of my favorite tools with Azure. I've found it useful to try to leverage existing tools whenever I can, and so as I've been experimenting with Azure I've been leveraging familiar tools like [Docker Machine][link-2] and [Vagrant][link-3].<!--more-->

The information here isn't revolutionary or unique, but hopefully it will still be useful to others, even if only as a "quick reference"-type of post.

## Launching an Instance on Azure Using Docker Machine

To launch an instance on Azure and provision it with Docker using `docker-machine`:

```sh
docker-machine create -d azure \
--azure-subscription-id $(az account show --query "id" -o tsv) \
--azure-ssh-user azureuser \
--azure-size "Standard_B1ms" azure-test
```

The first time you run this you'll probably need to allow Docker Machine access to your Azure subscription (you'll get prompted to log in via a browser and allow access). This will create a service principal that is visible via `az ad sp list`. Note that you may be prompted for authentication for future uses, although it will re-use the existing service principal once it is created.

## Launching an Instance Using the Azure Provider for Vagrant

See [this page][link-1] for complete details on using the Azure provider for Vagrant. Basically, it boils down to these four steps:

1. Install the Azure provider using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-azure`.
2. Add a "dummy" box (similar to how you use Vagrant with AWS; see this post).
3. Set up an Azure service principal for Vagrant to use to connect to Azure.
4. Run `vagrant up` and you're off to the races.

A more detailed post on [using Vagrant with Azure is available here][xref-1]; it provides a bit more information on the above steps.

## Launching an Instance using the Azure CLI

OK, maybe the Azure CLI isn't exactly an "existing tool," but given my affinity for CLI-based tools I think it's probably reasonable to include it here. To launch an instance using the Azure CLI, it would look something like this:

```sh
az vm create -n vm-name -g group-name --image UbuntuLTS \
--size Standard_B1ms --no-wait
```

Of course, this assumes a pre-existing resource group. More details are available [here][link-5].

If you need to install the Azure CLI, see [here][xref-2] or [here][xref-3] for some additional information.

Happy experimenting!
