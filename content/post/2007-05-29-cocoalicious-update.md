[Cocoalicious](http://alittledrop.com/cocoalicious/), the native [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) front-end to the [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) bookmark system, has been updated and now sports (in my opinion) a cleaner user interface that bodes well for future development.

Gone is the brushed metal look; in is a unified toolbar. A recent posting by the developer alludes to a more "modern" look that resembles Mail.app or NetNewsWire. I, for one, welcome the changes and I am excited to see the changes with the application. So excited, in fact, that I've done something I'd never done before with an open source project: I volunteered to help. I'm not a programmer, but I figured there's bound to be something I can do to help.

If you are a Mac user who also uses del.icio.us, you owe it to yourself to try out Cocoalicious.
