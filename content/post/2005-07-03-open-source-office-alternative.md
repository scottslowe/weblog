Those individuals searching for an open source alternative to [Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/) ([Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) isn't the only Microsoft monopoly, you know) on [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) should take note of NeoOffice/J 1.1, released a few weeks ago. [This article](http://www.macnn.com/articles/05/06/21/neooffice.j.1.1.released/) on [MacNN](http://www.macnn.com/) alerted me to the release a while ago, but I've only just now gotten around to mentioning it here.

I've made no secret of the fact that I try not to be partial in any way with regards to technology solutions. If NeoOffice/J fits your needs, perfect. If not, use Microsoft Office. It's just nice to see that we actually _have_ some choices, however limited they may be, when it comes to choosing office productivity software.

I'm also hoping that the approval of the XML-based OpenOffice 2.0 file formats by [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/) (see [this article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1819239,00.asp?)) will help further spur more interoperability between office productivity applications. Now, if we could just get Microsoft on board with this vendor-neutral format...
