I see this question popping up a lot, so I thought I'd just throw up this quick blog entry with the command that's necessary to set the load balancing policy for a VMware ESX vSwitch.

In VMware ESX 3.5 U2 (which users should be using if at all possible, now that [it's validated by Microsoft][1]), the command to do this is vmware-vim-cmd:

```bash
vmware-vim-cmd /hostsvc/net/vswitch_setpolicy --nicteaming-policy=loadbalance_ip vSwitch1
```

This command sets the vSwitch to use "Route based on ip hash". To set the vSwitch back to "Route based on the originating virtual port ID", use this command:

```bash
vmware-vim-cmd /hostsvc/net/vswitch_setpolicy  --nicteaming-policy=loadbalance_srcid vSwitch1
```

Obviously, users will need to replace vSwitch1 with the appropriate vSwitch that needs to be configured. Note that this command is a bit different than in earlier versions, which used `vimsh`.

I hope this is useful!
