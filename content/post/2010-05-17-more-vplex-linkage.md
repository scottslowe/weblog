I'll have my own write-up on VPLEX soon---I'm taking the time to prepare a thoughtful response rather than just repeating the same things that have been said elsewhere---but until then here are some of the things that are being said elsewhere (note that I've included negative coverage as well, to show that I welcome all viewpoints):
