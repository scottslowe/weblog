There's a lot of chatter on the Internet today about the [MS06-001](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS06-001.mspx) patch from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), designed to address the "zero-day" WMF flaw for which numerous exploits were circulating. Here's a brief look at some of the links.

[Microsoft Ships 'Emergency' WMF Patch](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1908393,00.asp)

[MS Rushes Patch as WMF Exploit Tools Surface](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1908426,00.asp): Of particular interest in this article is the WMFMaker exploit tool, a simple and straightforward tool that allows novice hackers to add malicious code to a WMF image.

Lest you think that malicious web sites were the only attack vector, read ["Attempts to exploit WMF vulnerability by IM multiply",](http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,107455,00.html) which indicates that more than 70 variants of IM-based attacks have been identified.

One very interesting statement from one of the articles linked above was a note about the lifetime of this flaw and its related exploits. Just as even now we are still dealing with years-old virii and worms circulating the Internet, we can be sure that malicious WMF files will be around, exploiting older versions of Windows for which Microsoft did not release a patch because they are "end of life" (like pre-SP4 Windows 2000, for example).
