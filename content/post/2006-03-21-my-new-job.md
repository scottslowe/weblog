I started work at [ePlus Technology](http://www.eplus.com/) yesterday. I had originally thought that my first day would be [on March 13][1], but things got delayed until the 20th. So far, things are going pretty well.

One of my first assignments is to get up to speed with VMware's high-end products, [ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/esx/) and [VirtualCenter](http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/). I'm signed up for a VMware class in May and hope to be getting some hands-on experience with the products in the next week or so. Having already worked with GSX Server (soon to be replaced by [VMware Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/server/)) fairly extensively, I don't expect the learning curve for ESX Server to be too bad. I have a feeling that most people getting into ESX Server for the first time probably aren't command-line people; I, on the other hand, sometimes feel like I live at the command line. I should feel pretty comfortable. I've managed to dig up some good resources with the organization as well; that's one key advantage of working for a larger company.

I knew that integration of my [PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) onto their corporate network would be a challenge, and I was right. I had spent a fair amount of time on my network making sure that everything was cross-platform, but not here. I'm going to be working first on universal e-mail access, so that I can use IMAP both inside and outside (without having to establish a VPN first). I haven't quite worked out all the details yet, but I imagine it will involve the use of the [Perdition IMAP proxy](http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/) and some DNS cunning. I also need to get LDAP queries from the [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) Address Book working against the corporate Global Address Book, so that I don't have to add a bunch of people manually to my address book. [Snerdware](http://www.snerdware.com/), whose [Groupcal](http://www.snerdware.com/groupcal/) product I do use (even now) to push iCal data up into my Exchange calendar, also offers a product for helping with that (called [AddressX](http://www.snerdware.com/addressx/)), but I'd rather avoid having to purchase yet another license if at all possible. (And yes, I know that the Address Book has an option to synchronize with Exchange.) Unfortunately, all of these changes will have to be done on some sort of local scope; that's one key disadvantage of working for a larger comapny.

All in all, I'm excited about the opportunities that are ahead of me, particularly with regards to learning some new products. Stay tuned!
