The new Apple Store in Raleigh opened yesterday at Crabtree Valley Mall. I had started to mention this on my weblog yesterday, but initially dismissed the idea. Then I saw [this article](http://www.jbctech.com/2006/06/25/new-apple-store-in-raleigh/), and decided, "Hey, I'm not the only one that was excited about the new Apple store!"

Unlike [James](http://www.jbctech.com/), I didn't bother trying to get there early enough to be one of the first 1,000 customers and get a free T-shirt. Instead, my son and I had a leisurely morning and got over there around 11:30 AM. Man, was it packed! The store is a bit smaller than the only other Apple store in the area (at Streets of Southpoint in Durham), and with the crowd that was there for the grand opening it was standing room only. I wanted to hang around and play with a [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) (I'm trying to talk myself into buying one), but my son was definitely _not_ interested in hanging out with all those people. We left to enjoy some coin rides instead (it's about the important things in life, you know).
