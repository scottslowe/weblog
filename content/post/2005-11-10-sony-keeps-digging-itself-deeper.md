The furor over the rootkit technology used by Sony in their DRM software continues to grow. After Mark Russinovich [unveiled the truth](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html), Sony released a patch that supposedly allows for the DRM technology to be uninstalled. Of course, Mark [reviewed the uninstallation](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/more-on-sony-dangerous-decloaking.html), and he found it left a little bit to be desired (putting it mildly). Basically, it left you at risk of a blue screen of death. And Mark's not the only one not satisfied---[this article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1883820,00.asp) cites several other security experts as well who are not happy with this situation.

Then, First 4 Internet (the company behind the cloaking technology that Sony uses for their DRM software) [responds](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sonys-rootkit-first-4-internet.html) to Mark's posts and attempts to refute his findings. Finally, today, Mark posted more details on the [actual uninstallation process](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sony-you-dont-reeeeaaaally-want-to_09.html) and what is required in order to make it work.

Sony just keeps digging itself deeper and deeper into this hole. It's bad enough that the company uses stealth/cloaking technologies to hide their files. It's bad enough by itself that the DRM software is communicating back to Sony whenever a CD is played. It's bad enough that the uninstallation process requires so many steps and is so complicated.

Finally, to make matters worse...check out [this news](http://entmag.com/news/article.asp?editorialsid=7033).

Put it all together, and you get a mistake so massive that it could change Sony's business fortunes. Don't believe me? Are **_you_** going to buy any Sony CDs or software now, after everything that's been disclosed? I'm not, that's for sure. (Of course, I don't really have to worry about it that much since I'm using a Mac and not Windows, but that's a different story for a different day.)
