title: VMware Giving Away Server for Free?

Lots of bloggers are talking about the rumors, perhaps justified, that [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) will announce on Monday, February 6, that it is giving away for free a product called "VMware Server." It's not clear yet if this is actually the equivalent of [VMware GSX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/gsx/), or if this is entirely new product.

I was first [alerted to this possibility](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/?p=178) by a posting at [RTFM Education](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/); soon after that, more articles began cropping up in various places:

* [VMware moves to free with Server product](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/03/vmware_goes_free/)

* [VMware cuts VMware Server price to zero](http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/02/03/1656204)

* [VMware Server to become a free product](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2006/02/04/437331.aspx)

* [VMware to give virtualization server for free](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/02/breaking-news-vmware-to-make-server.html)

There's bound to be some truth to all of this, since some of these stories are coming from fairly reputable sources (the [virtualization.info](http://www.virtualization.info/) article has a link to a CNet article).

If it's true, that's fantastic news---there are so many customers that I really want to start using virtualization, but I can't get them past the price tag. And while Microsoft's Virtual Server 2005 is a good product (just did an install for a customer yesterday, as a matter of fact), it's just not in the same league as VMware's products (in my humble opinion).

I'll post more once the official announcement occurs on Monday.
