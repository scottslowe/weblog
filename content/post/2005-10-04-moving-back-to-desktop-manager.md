Over the last few days or so, I have been experimenting with [Virtue][1], a virtual desktop application. I've used various virtual desktop applications since switching to [Mac OS X][2] (see [this blog posting][xref-1]). After getting used to the lack of a desktop pager, I was really beginning to like Virtue and it's functionality, even though it seemed as though the Virtue project had slowed and/or stopped development. Finally, after searching around for some way of re-instating the "Run Application" feature in [Desktop Manager][4], I found that Virtue was incompatible with Mac OS X 10.4, aka "Tiger." Since I've been researching the possibility of an upgrade to Tiger, I decided I'd better switch back to an application that was supposed to run under Tiger (which, based on what I've been able to find, Desktop Manager does).

It's a real shame, too. Virtue has a great feature set (I love the idea of the "primitives," which are text and/or colors that can be applied to individual desktops). I didn't use the per-desktop wallpaper functionality or the per-desktop icons, but I know a few people whose desktop-centric filing system would have really loved those features.

If I were a programmer, I'd probably pick up the code myself and run with it. But I'm not, so there you go.
