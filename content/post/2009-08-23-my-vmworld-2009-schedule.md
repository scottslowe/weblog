Well, VMworld 2009 is nearly upon us. Like thousands of others, I'll be there next week attending sessions, meeting with vendors, networking with other virtualization professionals, and---of course---covering all of it right here on my blog. So, if you aren't able to make it next week, stay tuned here for my coverage of the conference. And, to give you a feel of what I'll be doing and what sessions I'm planning on attending, here's my VMworld 2009 conference schedule.

## Sunday, August 30, 2009

All day Sunday I'll be attending the VMware Partner Technical Advisory Board (PTAB) meeting. I won't be able to provide any coverage of this event, as it's all hush-hush NDA stuff.

Sunday evening I'll be at the VMworld Underground event at The Thirsty Bear. We'll be giving away at least one copy of my book, _Mastering VMware vSphere 4,_ and networking with other virtualization geeks and gurus.

## Monday, August 31, 2009

Monday morning is tied up with the remainder of the PTAB meeting, then I'm spending the rest of the day with my lovely wife, Crystal (whom many of you already know has been planning activities for non-attending spouses). We'll most likely be at the Monday evening reception and possibly joining John Troyer's tweetup as well.

## Tuesday, September 1, 2009

Now things really get interesting. The VMworld conference really kicks off on Tuesday, and here's Tuesday's schedule:

9:30AM - BC1500  

11:00AM - BC3209  

12:30PM - Book signing at the VMworld conference bookstore  

1:00PM - LAB08  

3:00PM - DV2484  

4:30PM - BC2761

The day wraps up with dinner with some industry colleagues.

## Wednesday, September 2, 2009

## Thursday, September 3, 2009

7:00AM - Meeting with MokaFive  

8:15AM - Meeting with NetEx

11:00AM - Meeting with another company still in stealth mode  

12:00PM - Meeting with Seanodes  

1:00PM - TA2259 _(My session!)_  

2:00PM - Meeting with FalconStor  

3:00PM - Meeting with Embotics  

4:30PM - TA2259 again _(Repeat session!)_

The day (and the conference) wraps up with dinner with a friend and colleague. Crystal and I aren't flying back East until Saturday morning, so we'll spend Friday together seeing sights and spending some time together.

I'd be particuarly interested to know if there are specific questions that my readers would like me to ask some of the companies I'm meeting at the conference. Would readers like me to post some sort of summary of the meeting, like what sort of information was shared or my thoughts on the companies? I do plan on liveblogging the keynotes and as many of the sessions as possible, but I'm curious as to what other sort of coverage readers would be interested in seeing. Let me know in the comments.
