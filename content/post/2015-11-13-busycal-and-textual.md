I wanted to call out a couple of software packages whose vendors I've worked with recently that I felt had really good customer service. The software packages are [BusyCal][link-1] (from BusyCal, LLC) and [Textual][link-2] (from Codeux Software, LLC).

As many of you know, the Mac App Store (MAS) recently [suffered an issue due to an expired security certificate][link-3], and this caused many MAS apps to have to be re-downloaded or, in limited cases, to stop working (I'm looking at you, Tweetbot 1.6.2). This incident just underscored an uncomfortable feeling I've had for a while about using MAS apps (for a variety of reasons that I won't discuss here because that isn't the focus of this post). I'd already started focusing on purchasing new software licenses outside of the MAS, but I still had (and have) a number of MAS apps on my Macs.

As a result of this security certificate snafu, I started looking for ways to migrate from MAS apps to non-MAS apps, and BusyCal (a OS X Calendar replacement) and Textual (an IRC client) were two apps that I really wanted to continue to use but were MAS apps. The alternatives were dismal, at best.

Fortunately, both vendors allow for what I call "sidegrade" licenses that enable you to switch, without additional cost, from a MAS version to a non-MAS version purchased directly from the vendor. Allow me to publicly say **"Kudos!"** to these two vendors for looking out for their customers and promoting customer choice in how their software is consumed. I was able to quickly and easily switch both apps from the MAS version to the direct version (without a loss of data, might I add).

Unfortunately, I'm still left with a number of MAS-only apps for which there does not appear to be a suitable replacement. Aside from Tweetbot ([the Twitter client scene on OS X is as pitiful as it has ever been][xref-1]), the bulk of these remaining applications are Apple-provided apps (like GarageBand and the like) that I very rarely (if ever) use. For the developers of the apps I _do_ still use (Tweetbot, Day One, Deckset, Downcast, and Patterns), allow me to encourage you to follow in the footsteps of _many_ other Mac developers and begin offering your applications independently as well as via the MAS. Believe me, your customers will thank you for it.
