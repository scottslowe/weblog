A few days ago I discussed the possibility of [VMware giving away GSX Server for free][1]. With the official announcement now made and lots of articles appearing about the subject, I thought I'd provide an update.

Yes, it's true. The next generation of GSX Server, called VMware Server, will be provided at no charge. Rather than rehash all the same information, allow me to point you in the direction of some very pertinent articles from those more educated:

* [VMware Server Goes Free, but Not Open](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1920441,00.asp)

* [More details on VMware Server](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/02/more-details-on-vmware-server.html)

* [VMware details migration terms for GSX Server customers](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/02/vmware-details-migration-terms-for-gsx.html)

* [Offical: VMware Introduces Free VMware Server](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/?p=184)

* [VMware introduces free VMware Server](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/02/vmware-introduces-free-vmware-server.html)

Overall, I'm very excited. Some of the VMware installations I manage could really use the Virtual SMP functionality. I'm toying with the idea of testing the beta, but I'm not sure yet. I'll probably wait just a bit longer.

Now, let's hope they don't push everything into some clunky web-based interface...
