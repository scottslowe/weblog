title: 'Review: Dell Latitude E7370'

As part of my Linux migration (see my [initial progress report][xref-1]), late this past week I started setting up my first non-Apple laptop since 2003. In this post, I'd like to share my thoughts on my new laptop, a Dell Latitude E7370.

First, let's get the specs---the "speeds and feeds"---out of the way:

* Intel Core m7 CPU
* 16 GB of RAM
* 512 GB NVMe SSD
* 3200x1800 touchscreen
* Intel HD graphics and Intel 802.11a/b/g/n/ac wireless

Based on the specs alone, it's easy to see this laptop is no slouch. It's certainly comparable to [the latest-generation of MacBook Pro laptops][link-1], except for the touchscreen (which the Macs don't offer/support).

Subjectively, I have to say I'm impressed with the E7370. I travel quite a bit, so size and weight are important. This laptop looks and feels more svelte than my previous laptop, a 13" MacBook Air. From a comparison perspective, I'd say it's on par with my son's 11" MacBook Air. The build quality is great, and the laptop feels solid and sturdy. The display is crisp, sharp, and bright, and battery life (so far, without any OS-level tuning) has been respectable. Unlike some previous ultrabooks I've seen, Dell's done a good job not only keeping the laptop slim and trim, but also keeping the power adapter's size and heft under control.

I had a few folks online make some condescending remarks about the Dell, calling it "garbage," "cheap trash," and the like. Look, I get it---I used an Apple laptop for 14 years. From a Titanium PowerBook G4 to multiple generations of aluminum MacBook Pros to (finally) a MacBook Air, I'm familiar with the quality and reliability of Apple hardware. Heck, my 2006-era MacBook Pro was in active use until just last year. While it's too soon yet to say how well this Dell E7370 will hold up to the rigors of travel, I _can_ honestly say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality of this laptop. (Naturally, I'll keep everyone posted on how things are progressing once I've had some time with it on the road.) If you're in the market for a new laptop, I'd strongly encourage you to keep an open mind. You may just be surprised as well.

Finally, with regard to my Linux migration, I'm happy to say that [Fedora][link-2] 25 runs flawlessly on the E7370, with everything working as expected _out of the box._ If you're considering moving to Linux, the E7370 may be a good platform to consider.
