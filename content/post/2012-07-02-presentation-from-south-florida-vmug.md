Back in early March I was invited to speak at the South Florida VMUG, and I gave this presentation on vSphere networking challenges and solutions. The idea behind the presentation was to give attendees some visibility into IEEE and IETF efforts at creating new network technologies and protocols. I'm posting it here just in case someone might find it useful or helpful.

Here is [a link to the presentation][1].

As always, your questions, corrections, or clarifications are welcome in the comments below.

**UPDATE:** During the blog migration in late 2014, all embedded presentations were converted to linked presentations.
