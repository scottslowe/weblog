title: VMworld 2016 Prayer Time

For the last couple of years, I've helped organize a gathering of Christians for a brief time of prayer while at [VMworld][link-1]. This year, I’d like to again offer fellow believers attending VMworld 2016 the same opportunity to gather together for a time of prayer before starting the day. If you’re interested in attending, here are the details.

**What:** A brief time of prayer

**Where:** Mandalay Bay Convention Center, level 1 (same level as the food court), at the bottom of the escalators heading upstairs

**When:** Monday 8/29 through Thursday 9/1 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before the keynotes start at 9am)

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note that this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity. (I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities.)

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the conference, and the attendees

As in previous years, there’s no need to RSVP or let me know that you’ll be there, although you’re welcome to do so if you’d like. There’s also no need to bring anything except an open heart and a willingness to display your faith in front of others. This is a very casual gathering of believers---we’ll gather together, share some prayer requests and needs, and then say a few words of prayer over each other and over the conference.

See you there!
