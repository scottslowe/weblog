After a lengthy hiatus---prompted by a pandemic and the suspension of in-person events as a result---Spousetivities returns to [VMware Explore][link-1]! VMware Explore, the event formerly known as VMworld, is happening in Las Vegas, NV, and Spousetivities will be there offering organized activities for spouses, partners, significant others, family, or friends traveling with conference attendees. [Registration is already open][link-2]!<!--more-->

Thanks to the support of [Veeam][link-3] and [Synterex][link-4], Crystal has organized a great set of activities happening during VMware Explore:

* _Downtown food tour (with or without cocktails):_ How about a private food tour in Vegas’ newly revitalized area of Fremont East? This area is now home to the city’s most exciting dining scene with local chefs crafting imaginative farm-to-table, seasonal, artisan fare.
* _Scenic Route 66 tour:_ "Get your kicks, On Route 66"! Visit a unique desert winery and two distilleries on historic Route 66. Total tour time is approximately five hours.
* _Emerald Cave kayak tour:_ What could be better than a day of kayaking on the Colorado River? This amazing 5 mile kayaking tour in the spectacular Black Canyon is sure to be an amazing adventure. You should have a chance to see plenty of desert wildlife, and you'll visit Emerald Cave. There will be single and double kayaks available.

These are exclusive tours with private transportation provided, with prices discounted thanks to the support of Veeam and Synterex.
