It looks like things will work out next week that I'll be able to post some additional information on some technologies I've mentioned recently.

First up will be access-based enumeration. One of my customers is planning on using this technology and we need to make sure that the potential performance impacts mentioned by [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) aren't going to be a deal-breaker. So, once I have some additional information, I'll post it here.

Next will be the [XC Connect](http://www.xcnetwork.com/xcconnect.jsp) software I mentioned a few posts back. I just finished downloading the Linux version of the XC Connect server software, and hope to have that installed on a [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) system soon for testing. Again, after some testing with the product, I'll post more information here.
