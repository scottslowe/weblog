Clearly, I am having a _much_ harder time covering VMworld 2008 than I had covering Tech-Ed or VMworld 2007. There's just so much going on! In an effort to try to broaden the coverage, here are some links from other bloggers and resources:

I think that's it for now, although I'm sure that I'm missing tons of additional coverage. Other bloggers, if I missed you---and rest assured no one was excluded intentionally---please add links in the comments below. It would be great to consolidate as many relevant links as possible. Thanks!
