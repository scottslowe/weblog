title: 'Technology Short Take #64'
url: /2016/04/04/technology-short-take-64/
---

Welcome to Technology Short Take #64. Normally, I try to publish Short Takes on Friday, but this past Friday was April Fools' Day. Given the propensity for "real" information to get lost among all the pranks, I decided to push this article back to today. Unlike most of what is published around April Fools' Day, hopefully everything here is helpful, informative, and useful!

## Networking

* Phil Gervasi has an article on [fate sharing in the network core][link-1], where he discusses some of the advantages---and disadvantages---of centralizing the control plane in network designs. The examples Phil uses include StackWise, Virtual Switching System, and Virtual Port Channels.
* Alban Crequy has a post on using Linux queueing disciplines (qdiscs, for short) to help with [testing application behavior under degraded network conditions][link-6]. This is really interesting and something that I want to explore in more detail.
* Cumulus Networks has added another hardware partner to its list of supported hardware partners; this time it's Mellanox, as outlined in [this SDx Central article][link-7].
* Carlos Cardenas has a great post that does a great job of [explaining SAI (Switch Abstraction Interface) and switchdev][link-8], two key abstraction layers involved in building Linux-based network operating systems (NOSes). Carlos also has a good article [taking a deeper look at Microsoft SONiC][link-13].
* Among a _lot_ of other great content, Russ White has three (so far) articles on the design mindset ([part 1][link-31], [part 2][link-32], [part 3][link-33]). While Russ' articles are written from a network engineering perspective---hence why I'm putting them in this section---the underlying principles he's discussion could be just as easily applied to any sort of IT design project. Highly recommended reading!

## Servers/Hardware

* Kevin Houston has [a write-up on the recent Intel "Broadwell" announcement][link-34] that provides details on the latest CPU family.

## Security

* Andreas Wittig reminds people of the common-sense [security rules regarding SSH key pairs][link-22], specifically with Amazon EC2, and provides a few suggestions for how to address shared key pairs. Personally, I would have liked to see much more detail on the suggested workarounds.

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Rodney Haywood has a great post that shows how to use my new favorite tool `jq` with the AWS pricing file to be able to determine [which instances are available in your desired region][link-4]. Good stuff.
* VMware recently released version 0.8 of Photon Controller, and James Zabala has [a blog post describing the new Photon Controller release][link-9]. Photon Controller is open source and available [from GitHub][link-10], so feel free to give it a spin.
* The latest buzzword to hit the industry is "serverless architecture." Now, we all know that cloud is just someone else's computer, and that there's no such thing as a truly serverless architecture (there are _going_ to be servers somewhere). Paul Johnston tackles [the definition of serverless architecture][link-16] in this post, and I think it's worth a read.
* Hassan Hamade from VMware has [an in-depth post on vRA network profiles][link-21] that might be helpful if you're working with vRA and NSX.

## Operating Systems/Applications

* Sebastien Goasguen has a decent [introductory article to using Docker Compose][link-2]. If you're new to Compose, this might be a good place to start. After you've read Sebastien's introductory article, then take it to the next level by combining Compose with Docker Machine and Docker Swarm in [this post][link-3] by Arun Gupta.
* Florian Haas of Hastexo takes on the current model of container deployments in a post that describes [a new approach using LXC in combination with OverlayFS][link-12]. It's a very interesting model that could offer some great benefits, and it's an approach that I hope to be able to try out myself soon.
* Although Docker Swarm 1.1.0 added native rescheduling of containers on failures of Swarm nodes, there are still some challenges in leveraging this functionality. Maximilian Sch√∂fmann describes some of these challenges in [this blog post][link-15].
* If you're a total beginner and trying to come up to speed on containers, VMs, and Docker, read [this post][link-17]. Preethi does a good job of breaking down terminology and concepts, specifically targeting folks who are new to the technology.
* LogPacker has a couple of blog posts (two posts so far) talking about service discovery with [Consul][link-20] ([part 1][link-18] and [part 2][link-19]). Consul and service discovery with Consul are things I've discussed before (see [here][xref-3] and [here][xref-4]), but the LogPacker articles provide a good overview of the terms and concepts involved.
* Project Platypus looks interesting. What is Platypus? In the words of Paul Gifford, it's an effort "to provide a Swagger based documentation of several VMware Products". Check out [this project update][link-28] and [this example of working with Platypus][link-29].

## Storage

* Karim Vaes has a post describing [various storage patterns for persistence with Docker containers][link-14]. It's a good post for those seeking to solidify their understanding of how to handle persistence in a Docker-centric environment.
* Now that ScaleIO 2.0 supports Ubuntu (see [Chad's article][link-35]), I may have to give it a closer look.

## Virtualization

* I can't recall if I've mentioned this before, but just for the sake of completeness I'll include it here again: the VMware Host Client, a HTML5-based UI used to connect and manage single ESXi hosts, has reached version 1.0 and is now GA as part of vSphere 6.0 U2. More information is available [here][link-11]. Nice!
* Finally, [an HTML5-based vSphere Web Client][link-23]. Go get it. Now.
* Jon Benedict (aka "Captain KVM") blogged recently about [hot adding CPUs in RHEV][link-24]. I wasn't aware that RHEV supported hot-adding CPUs; I thought this was only a feature of vSphere/ESXi and Hyper-V. Anyone know if this will make it into the underlying open source projects underneath RHEV, or is the functionality already there?
* Anthony Burke is flexing his sysadmin skills (he comes from a predominantly networking-centric background) by [using PowerCLI to upgrade vSphere][link-25].
* William Lam worked with one of the VMware engineers, Songtao Zheng, to get an (unsupported) USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter driver working for ESXi 5.5 and 6.0. Read more about it [in William's blog post][link-26]. Also, check out William's [article on using virtual serial ports][link-27] as a way of capturing nested ESXi troubleshooting information.
* Pete Long has a good article on [converting a VirtualBox VM to VMware Fusion][link-30].

## Career/Soft Skills

* Tyler Britten takes a different approach to e-mail management with [his "Inbox - Meh" approach][link-5]. Honestly, his approach isn't terribly different from what I described in 2013 (see [here][xref-1] and [here][xref-2]). I'd say don't focus so much on "getting to zero"; instead, focus on _processing_ your e-mail so that you can get on with your real work.

It's time to wrap up now. See you again soon!
