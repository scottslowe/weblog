As many of you probably already know, I'll be participating in an Ask The Experts session at VMworld 2009 in San Francisco, CA, this year. Together with Rick Scherer (of [VMwareTips.com](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/)), Chad Sakac ([Virtual Geek](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/)), Tom Howarth ([PlanetVM](http://planetvm.net/blog/)), and Duncan Epping ([Yellow Bricks](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/)), we'll be taking questions on virtualization design.

If you have a question you'd like to see addressed during the session, here's your opportunity to submit your question in advance! Use the form below to submit questions to be considered for inclusion in the Ask The Experts session. The panel will select a small number of questions that will be addressed during the session at VMworld 2009, along with questions submitted by the audience during the session.

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing many of you in San Francisco later this year!

**Update as of 8/14/2009: Sorry, the call for questions for TA2259 has closed.** However, if you are attending VMworld 2009, please feel free to join us in person. The session is running at 1PM and again at 4:30PM on Thursday, September 3.
