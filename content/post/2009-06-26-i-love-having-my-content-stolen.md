You know, it's really irritating when you pour your heart and soul into something, only to find someone else riding your coattails and leeching off your efforts. It would appear that NetworkVirtualization.com is one such leech.

I have no problem with other sites syndicating my content _**as long as proper attribution of the original author and original site is provided.**_ Do me a favor: visit some of the URLs below (I'm not going to hyperlink them and give the site a traffic boost) and tell me how any of the examples I've listed below provide proper attribution of the original author and the original site:

```text
http://networkvirtualization.com/content/unified-fabric-inevitability  

http://networkvirtualization.com/content/vmware-io-queues-micro-bursting-and-multipathing  

http://networkvirtualization.com/content/tap-vsphere-pvscsi-performance-separate-vm-boot-and-data-drives
```

Let's see...content from my site, [Chad Sakac's site](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/), and [Rich Brambley's site](http://vmetc.com/), all syndicated on their site without any clear attribution back to the original post---except for a very small link near the bottom of the article. If you hadn't been looking for that link, or if I hadn't told you that the articles above were written by me, Chad, and Rich, respectively, would you have known? And those are just the authors I recognized! How many more are there that I don't recognize?

To whomever is running NetworkVirtualization.com: if you are going to syndicate content, you need to provide proper attribution. Otherwise, taking someone else's content and allowing people to believe that it's yours is called **plagiarism**, and it's wrong.
