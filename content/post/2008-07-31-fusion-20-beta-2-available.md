The best (in my humble opinion) option for virtualization on Mac OS X, VMware Fusion, now has Beta 2 of Fusion 2.0 available for download. You can read [VMware's announcement of the new beta](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2008/07/safer-stronger.html) as well as [read about new features](http://www.vmware.com/communities/content/beta/fusion/fusion2_beta2.html) online from VMware's web site.

Because this is a beta, I'm not really permitted to provide a review _per se_ of the product, but I can tell you that I am impressed with Fusion's development and I'm particularly glad to see the Fusion team adding more "power user" features, like a command-line interface, and multiple snapshots. Also impressive is the continued host-guest integration such as improvements to Unity, improved 3D and HD video support, and QuickLook integration. Again, this is just further proof of the coming age of [application agnosticism][1].
