My favorite [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) web browser, [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/), has finally reached 1.0 status! Built using the same Gecko rendering engine as [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), Camino is not a Mac OS X port of Firefox, but a separate project built specifically to integrate into the Macintosh environment.

Accompanying the final Camino release is Karlheinz Dobler's fantastic [CamiTools](http://www.nada.de/mac/camitools/) add-on, now at version 4.1. Taking advantage of Camino's extensible Preference Panes, CamiTools add some extremely useful functionality to the browser. This includes the ability to further enhance Camino's ad-blocking functionality, as well as the ability to block Flash animations, tune Camino performance, customize Camino's appearance, and more.

Both Camino 1.0 and CamiTools 4.1 are also Universal apps, running natively on either PowerPC- or Intel-based Macs.

Bottom line: If you're a Macintosh user, you need to be using Camino. If you're a Camino user, you need to be using CamiTools.
