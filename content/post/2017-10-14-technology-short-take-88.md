title: 'Technology Short Take 88'
url: /2017/10/14/technology-short-take-88/

Welcome to Technology Short Take #88! Travel is keeping me pretty busy this fall (so much for things slowing down after VMworld EMEA), and this has made it a bit more difficult to stick to my self-imposed biweekly schedule for the Technology Short Takes (heck, I couldn't even get this one published on Friday!). Sorry about that! Hopefully the irregular schedule is outweighed by the value found in the content I've collected for you.<!--more-->

## Networking

* Christopher Davis has an article discussing [a recommended VPC subnet configuration][link-11]. This is, of course, just _one_ way of handling subnets within a VPC, but some of the principles outlined in Christopher's article are definitely sound.
* Speaking of VPCs and subnets, here's [an example of a Terraform module][link-12] for a VPC with public, private, and internal subnets (similar to the article in the previous bullet).
* Prefer SaltStack to Terraform? No worries, Calvin Hendryx-Parker has [an example of building AWS VPCs with SaltStack formulas][link-13].
* Phil Bedard (TME at Cisco) has a post discussing [telemetry in Cisco IOS-XR][link-14].
* Fidelis Ekezue has [a high-level "compare-and-constrast" between AWS VPCs and Azure VNETs][link-15]. This article is pretty high-level; I wish it had a bit more depth to it.
* Abdullah Abdullah shares some thoughts on [design decisions regarding NSX VXLAN control plane replication modes][link-17].
* Romain Decker has [an "under the hood" look][link-21] at the VMware NSX load balancer.

## Servers/Hardware

Nothing this time (sorry!). I'll keep an eye open for links to include next time around.

## Security

* Mike Foley [provides an overview][link-26] of key manager concepts and topology basics for VM and vSAN encryption.
* If you're studying for your CISSP, you might find [this article][link-34] helpful.

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Mark Brookfield [shares the fix][link-2] for missing Puppet attributes on vRealize Automation blueprints.
* Jason Brooks has a write-up discussing [how to run Kubernetes on Fedora Atomic Host][link-3]. I haven't had the opportunity to try this out yet, but hope to do so in the next few weeks.
* [Via Joe Beda on Twitter][link-9], I saw [this announcement][link-8] from CloudFlare about service workers. Joe's comment---"the merging of CDNs and cloud continues"---is pretty spot on, in my opinion.
* Colin Westwater discussing [using Terraform with vSphere][link-18] for "infrastructure as code".
* Here's a post on [upgrading to OpenStack Pike using Kolla and Kayobe][link-19].
* Doug Smith [outlines][link-20] a completely "Docker-free" Kubernetes setup (leveraging `kpod`, `buildah`, and CRI-O).
* [This graphical summary][link-24] of the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is pretty handy.

## Operating Systems/Applications

* For those of you that might be a bit behind the times and still getting up to speed on containers, Ryan Kelly has a post describing [containers for the vSphere admin][link-4].
* The popular open source container registry project, [Harbor][link-7], has released a new version (version 1.2). This version introduces vulnerability scanning (leveraging [the Clair project][link-6]), and Henry Zhang has [a blog post with more details][link-5].
* Brendan Gregg has a pretty detailed write-up on [migrating from Solaris to Linux][link-10] (pertinent given the recent layoff of the majority of the Solaris developers).
* If you're not clear on the role/status of CRI-O, check out [this article][link-22] by Scott McCarty of Red Hat.
* Michael Friis [provides more details][link-23] on a recent big change to the Docker Official Images: they're now multi-platform.

## Storage

* Ben Evans has a four-part series (so far) on vSAN. The series provides [an introduction and overview of licensing][link-28] (part 1), [a review of architecture and hardware recommendations][link-29] (part 2), [an overview of data availability][link-30] (part 3), and [a discussion of fault domains][link-31] (part 4).

## Virtualization

* Vladan Seget shares [how to create a VMware ESXi ISO image with the latest patches][link-1].
* Richard Arnold shares [some thoughts on VMware Cloud on AWS][link-32].
* Wouter Kursten shows how to use PowerCLI [to add ESXi users when the host is in Lockdown Mode][link-33] (and add them to the exception list).

## Career/Soft Skills

* Joel Knight shares [how he's tried to blog more in 2017][link-16]. There may be some tips here to help others seeking to "bulk up" on their blogging.
* Frank Milisi shares some information around stagnation and [how to tell if you're suffering from stagnation][link-25].
* John Allspaw has [a great write-up on blameless post-mortems and a Just Culture][link-27]. This is, in my humble opinion, a great article that _all_ IT professionals need to read, digest, and apply to their own interactions with others.

That's all for this time around. Thanks for reading!
