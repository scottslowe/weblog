As with the related post on [using Mock to rebuild sanlock 2.4 for CentOS 6.3][1], this post might seem a bit odd. Don't worry---I'll tie it into something else very soon. In this post, I'll show you how to use Mock to build RPMs for libssh2 1.4.1 for use with CentOS 6.3.

The information in this post is based on information found in two other very helpful pages:

[Using Mock to test package builds](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Mock_to_test_package_builds)  

[How to rebuild a package from Fedora or EPEL for RHEL, CentOS, or SL](https://www.zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/howto/rebuild_rpms)

I tested these instructions on a newly-built CentOS 6.3 VM, installed using the "Minimal Desktop" option. I haven't tested it on other RHEL variants or other versions, so keep that in mind.

First, you'll want to activate EPEL. You'll do that by downloading the RPM and using `yum localinstall` to install it. You can also use `rpm` to install it directly from the URL, but I prefer using `yum localinstall`. I've line-wrapped the EPEL URL with a backslash for readability.

```bash
wget http://fedora.mirrors.pair.com/epel/6/i386/\
epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
```

Once EPEL is installed, then install Mock and related tools:

```bash
yum install fedora-packager
```

This will download and install Mock and related tools such as rpmbuild.

Next, create a user under which you'll run all these commands, and make sure this account is a member of the `mock` group:

```bash
useradd makerpm -G mock
passwd makerpm
```

From here on, you'll want to be running as this user you just created, so switch to that user with `su - makerpm`.

The first step while running as the user you created is to setup the RPM build environment:

```bash
rpmdev-setuptree
```

Now that the directory structure is created, use `wget` to download the source RPM for libssh2 1.4.1-2 from the Fedora 17 release repository (the URL is line-wrapped here for readability):

```bash
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/17\
/Everything/source/SRPMS/l/libssh2-1.4.1-2.fc17.src.rpm
```

Move the source RPM to the `rpmbuild/SRPMS` directory:

```bash
mv libssh2-1.4.1-2.fc17.src.rpm ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
```

And, finally, rebuild the RPMs with `mock`:

```bash
mock --rebuild ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/libssh2-1.4.1-2.fc17.src.rpm
```

Assuming everything completes successfully (it did on my CentOS 6.3 VM), then you'll end up with a group of RPMs found in `/var/lib/mock/epel-6-x86_64/results` (the exact directory will vary based on OS version and build; I was using 64-bit CentOS 6.3). You should then be able to install those RPMs onto a CentOS 6.3 system using `yum localinstall` and the prerequisites will be managed properly.

Have fun!
