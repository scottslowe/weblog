It's no secret that I've been spending time over the last few months working with a number of open source technologies like KVM, Open vSwitch (OVS), and libvirt, all building up to a focus on how these pieces fit together as part of OpenStack. To help strengthen my OpenStack skills, I picked up a copy (actually my wife Crystal bought me a copy) of Kevin Jackson's _OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook_, a book that I've been working my way through. So far, it's been great---I highly recommend it.

Now I have the opportunity to help five lucky readers win a copy (either electronic or print) of _OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook_, courtesy of Packt Publishing. Sweet, eh?

It's pretty easy to be entered to win. Here's how:

1. First, head over to [the book's web site at Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/openstack-cloud-computing-cookbook/book). Read through the description of the book. You can even [download a copy of Chapter 3](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9781849517324-Chapter-03.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&utm_medium=free&utm_campaign=pdf) as a sample chapter for you to read.

2. Once you've read through the description of the book, post a comment **here on this site** telling me what you find most interesting about the book. That's it!

Five lucky winners will be selected to receive their choice of either an electronic copy of the book or a print copy of the book. Please note that winners from the US and Europe can choose from either print or electronic versions of the book; winners from all other areas are limited to the electronic version only.

The deadline to post your comment and be entered to win is January 15, 2013. Winners will be notified via e-mail, so be sure to use a valid e-mail address when you post your comment.

Good luck!
