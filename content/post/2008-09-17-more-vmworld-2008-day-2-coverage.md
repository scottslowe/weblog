As I fully expected, another day at VMworld 2008 has passed and I seriously, _seriously_ was not able to keep up with everything. I even blew off a session this afternoon that I **really** wanted to attend as well. Somebody, please---can you give me good session notes on TA2275, VMware Infrastructure Virtual Networking Future Directions? I'd be very grateful!

In any case, here's a round-up of more coverage of VMworld 2008 from various places around the Internet:

I guess that should about do it for today. Go have a look at some of these other articles; they captured information that I missed, and many of them have photos and shots of the keynote or other information. Enjoy!

Signing off for today...
