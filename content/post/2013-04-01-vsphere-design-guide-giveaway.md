You might have seen that [the second edition of _VMware vSphere Design_ was recently released][1]. How would you like to win a free copy?

Starting today (no, this **isn't** an April Fool's joke) and running through April 15, you can enter to win a signed print copy of _VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition_! I'm giving away a free, signed copy of the book to five lucky individuals who enter and win in this book giveaway contest.

Here's how to enter to win one of the 5 free, signed copies of the book: simply post a comment on this site telling me why you would find this book useful. _Yes, that's it!_

There are a few contest rules you'll want to note:

* You'll need to use a valid e-mail address when you post your comment, because if you're a winner I'll be contacting you via e-mail to get your shipping information.

* If I notify you via e-mail that you've been selected to win a copy but you fail to respond within 48 hours with your shipping address, I'll select a new winner in your place.

* Because I'm paying for the shipping out of my own pocket, I'll have to limit this contest to **continental US residents only.** (Sorry folks---my personal budget can't sustain sending print books worldwide.)

Aside from the limitation to continental US residents only, this contest is open to anyone, so don't hesitate---enter today!
