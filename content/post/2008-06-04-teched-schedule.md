I'll be in Orlando next week attending TechEd 2008 for IT Professionals, the second half of Microsoft's big technical conference. It was split this year into a developers' conference, running this week, and an IT professionals' conference that is slated for next week. Today I took some time to fill out my TechEd conference schedule and thought I'd share it here.

Here's my conference schedule:

If any readers are going to be at TechEd this year, please look me up. I'd love to have a chat. In addition, if anyone has any specific information they'd like me to try to find, feel free to let me know in the comments. I'll do what I can!
