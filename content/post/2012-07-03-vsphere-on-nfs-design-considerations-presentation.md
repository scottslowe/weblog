This presentation is one that I gave at the New Mexico, New York City, and Seattle VMUG conferences (this specific deck came from the Seattle conference, as you can tell by the Twitter handle on the first slide). The topic is design considerations for running vSphere on NFS. This isn't an attempt to bash NFS, but rather to educate users on the things to avoid if you're going to build a rock-solid NFS infrastructure for your VMware vSphere environment. I hope that someone finds it useful.

Here is [a link to the presentation][1].

My standard closing statements goes here---your questions, thoughts, corrections, or clarification (always courteous, please!) are welcome in the comments below.

**UPDATE:** All embedded presentations (such as the one originally found in this post) were converted to linked presentations during the blog migration at the end of 2014.
