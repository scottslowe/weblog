I've been phenomenally lucky to be involved in a number of book projects around VMware vSphere. I think that most people probably know me for the wildly popular _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ and _Mastering VMware vSphere 5_ books (released at VMworld 2009 and VMworld EMEA 2011, respectively), but in late 2010/early 2011 I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing on _VMware vSphere Design_. Even though that book hasn't sold as many units as the _Mastering_ books, it's a work of which I'm equally proud. The topic of designing vSphere environments can be difficult to address, but I think we did a pretty good job.

Today I'm excited to announce that Forbes Guthrie and I---along with some support from Kendrick Coleman---have undertaken a revision of that book, to be released as _VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition_.

In addition to a new cover design (nice, huh?), this new version of the book has a new interior as well! The book has been thoroughly updated to include design topics and considerations for vSphere 4, vSphere 5, and vSphere 5.1. In addition to discussing design topics like management, storage, networking, and security, Kendrick contributed content around design considerations for vCloud Director. The updated and expanded content makes this a great resource for anyone who will be designing VMware vSphere environments.

For more information about the book, or to see a list of resellers for the book, visit [the publisher's page](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118407911,descCd-buy.html).

Thanks, and I think I speak for Forbes and Kendrick when I say that we hope this resource is useful to you!
