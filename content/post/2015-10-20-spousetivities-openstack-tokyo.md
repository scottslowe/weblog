Regular readers of this site know that my wife, Crystal, organizes spouse activities (aka "Spousetivities", like the combination of "spouse" and "activities") at conferences. This year she's adding activities in Tokyo, Japan, in conjunction with the Fall OpenStack Summit!

Here's a quick look at what is planned:

* Tokyo city tour w/ tea ceremony (very cool!)
* Tour of Tokyo Tower, Meiji Jingu, and Odaiba
* A visit to Mt. Fuji and Hakone
* Nikko tour

More details on these activities is available on [the Spousetivities site][link-4].

The activities are funded in part by [VMware NSX][link-1] and [Blue Box][link-2] (their sponsorship helps reduce the cost of activities for participants). If you have a loved one (spouse, domestic partner, family member, friend, whatever!) traveling with you to Tokyo, head on over to [the registration page][link-3] to get them signed up for some great activities while you're at the Summit.
