The [Apple Support page](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macbookproefifirmwareupdate12.html) that describes the firmware update states that after the update, the Boot ROM Version will be reported by System Profiler as MBP11.0055.B08 (for 15-inch MacBook Pros) or MBP12.0061.B03 (for the 17-inch MacBook Pros).

OK, fair enough---but System Profiler on my 15-inch Core 2 Duo-based MacBook Pro reports the Boot ROM Version as MBP22.00A5.B00. Now, unless I'm reading that wrong, that would appear to be a _newer_ version than what the firmware update is reporting. That, in turn, implies that the newer MacBook Pros should not apply this firmware update. However, that information is not disclosed anywhere that I have yet seen.

Does anyone have more information on this?
