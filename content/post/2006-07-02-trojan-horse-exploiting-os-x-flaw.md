Within the last couple of days, the [Symantec Security Response](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/) web site posted a warning about a new [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)-based trojan horse called [OSX.Exploit.Launchd](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/osx.exploit.launchd.html). This trojan horse supposedly takes advantage of a vulnerability that [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) patched with the recent Mac OS X 10.4.7 update (for both [PowerPC](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosxupdate1047ppc.html) and [Intel](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosxupdate1047intel.html) Macs). This vulnerability, if exploited, can result in root access. But that's not all of the story.

The disclosure of this trojan horse---which, to my understanding, has not yet been seen in the wild---is making the rounds on more than a few web sites. The problem is that most of these sites are discussing the trojan horse, but aren't discussing one very important fact about this trojan horse: _it requires a local account._

That's right, folks, this is a local elevation of privilege account that requires that an attacker already have a local account on a system in order to exploit the vulnerability. To quote the [SecurityFocus BID ](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18724/info)for the Launchd vulnerability:

>Apple Mac OS X 'launchd' is prone to a local format-string vulnerability. A local attacker can exploit this issue through a malicious 'plist' file that includes externally supplied format specifiers that will be passed to the vulnerable code.

The key word here is "local." If a malicious user already has an account on your system, all bets are off anyway (in my books, at least).

This is not to make light of the vulnerability; it's good that Apple patched the vulnerability in the latest update to Mac OS X. However, I don't think that the level of media attention and hype being given to this vulnerability and supposed exploit are appropriate with the severity of the flaw. If this were a remotely exploitable flaw that could be easily scripted and automated, then there'd be significant reason to worry. But it's not, and as a result the likelihood of widespread "infection" from this trojan horse is pretty slim.
