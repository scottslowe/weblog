Here's an announcement that is **exclusive** to readers of my site: I have learned that Sanbolic---the company behind Melio FS and other products about which I've blogged before, including [very recently][1]---plans to offer free licenses of La Scala and Melio FS to beta testers of Windows Server 2008 R2.

That's right: free licenses for the La Scala volume manager and Melio FS shared file system for Windows Server 2008 R2 beta testers. The licenses will be good only during the beta period, and will allow beta testers to directly compare Melio FS to Microsoft's Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV). Both products are an enabling technology for the Live Migration functionality that Microsoft is planning on including with the next version of Hyper-V. Sanbolic is convinced that Melio FS is far superior to CSV, and wants beta testers to have the opportunity to see that for themselves. It's a bold move, in my opinion, and I have to applaud them for it. Let your product stand or fall on its own merits, I've said before, and that's exactly what Sanbolic is doing.

Expect the official announcement on the free La Scala and Melio FS licenses to show up from Sanbolic in the next few weeks.

In the meantime, feel free to review these other articles I've written about Sanbolic, Melio FS, La Scala, and/or Kayo FS:

  * [Melio FS, Hyper-V, and VMware ESX][2]
  * [Sanbolic Looking to Capitalize on Hyper-V Opportunity][3]
  * [Sanbolic Now Providing Shared LUN Access for Hyper-V Guests][4]
  * [Sanbolic Optimizes Melio FS, Adds Virtualization Support][5]

**UPDATE:** Sanbolic issued the official press release today (April 2, 2009; no direct link available for the press release), making the announcement about the free evaluation version of Melio FS for Windows Server 2008 R2 beta users.
