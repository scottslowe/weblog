I mentioned on Twitter yesterday that I was doing some basic/introductory reading on MPLS, and someone asked what materials I was using. While I'm still _very early_ in the process of trying to understand MPLS, I thought I might share the resources I've used so far in trying to wrap my head around MPLS, what it is, and the basics of how it works.

Here are some of the sites I've used so far:

[MPLS Terminology](http://cisco-press-traffic-engineering.org.ua/1587050315/ch02lev1sec1.html)  

[MPLS VPN terminology](http://wiki.nil.com/MPLS_VPN_terminology)  

[MPLS Basics - LSR Terminology](http://packet-lab.com/main/service-provider/ccip/item/111-mpls-basics-lsr-terminology.html)  

[Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS MPLS Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5_x/nx-os/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_mpls_overview.html)  

[MPLS, Multi-Protocol Label Switching](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/mpls.htm)  

As you can see, right now I'm focusing on what I call the _grammar_--that is, the day-to-day terminology and acronyms that are prevalent throughout any and all discussions of MPLS. Being able to recognize and know what an LSR is or what label imposition means is important and prepares me for future stages of learning. (Some people may recognize my use of "grammar" here as taken from the [classical education approach](http://www.welltrainedmind.com/classical-education/).)

Even based on my limited reading so far, I'm beginning to get an idea of why MPLS can be so useful---and why MPLS can be complex. I'm looking forward to continuing my MPLS education. Resources and recommended reading are welcome in the comments!
