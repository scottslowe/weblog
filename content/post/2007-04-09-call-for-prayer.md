I know that my weblog defies the "normal rules" of how one should run a weblog in that I freely mix both personal and professional topics on the same site. As I said in [my very first post][1], I can't hide who I am, and I am a Christian. If that means that my Christianity bleeds into everything else, so be it.

I don't know if you read my site for my technical articles, or for my occasional personal post, and I don't know if any of you reading out there are indeed Christians. If you are a follower of Christ, then I'd like to make a simple request of you: please pray for my family.

My family is going through a rough time right now. The details of the specific situation aren't important; what's important is that I---we---continue to lean upon the Lord and His strength in order to make it through the storm. To do that, we've already enlisted the help of many prayer warriors that we know personally. Now I seek the help of prayer warriors that I don't know personally.

This situation that we are going through will come to a head sometime next week. If you could, please remember my family in your prayers throughout the remainder of this week. My wife and I are praying together with the family nightly, and praying with each other every day. Our friends, our pastors (past and present), Christian co-workers, and fellow church members also have us on their prayer lists. Will you pray as well? I know that through the combined prayer and faith of the believers that my family can emerge through this situation with a powerful testimony to share with others.
