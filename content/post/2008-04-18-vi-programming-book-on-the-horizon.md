Andrew Kutz shot me an e-mail today about a new book he'll be authoring, due to be published by O'Reilly sometime next year. Quoting from his [VMware Communities post](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/140270):

>Here is the deal. In a past life I was a monk who saved children from evil orphanage owners and small animals from evil masters and thus karma has seen fit to reward me with the opportunity of a lifetime. O'Reilly is allowing me to abuse their imprint with "Programming and Managing VMware Infrastructure"...
>
>...The book is proposed to be completed by next March, so hopefully it will hit shelves late spring / early summer.

Judging from Andrew's [work on VI client plugins][1], I'm sure the new book will be an excellent guide. I probably won't buy it, not because of Andrew or anything else other than the fact that I completely and totally stink at programming. A one-line routine that prints "Hello World!" is about the sum of my talent.

Congratulations, Andrew, and good luck with the book!
