In previous versions of Mac OS X, I could use this command to flush the DNS resolver cache:

```bash
lookupd -flushcache
```

However, in Mac OS X version 10.5 "Leopard," this command no longer works! I had an occasion today where I needed to flush the DNS resolver cache due to a configuration error in the lab. Fortunately a quick Google search turned up [this page](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/how-to-clear-dns-cache-in-mac-osx-leopard/), where I found that the correct command to use in Leopard is this one:

```bash
dscacheutil -flushcache
```

Works like a champ!
