title: Talking Containers, Virtualization, and Interop

Last year, I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at [Interop][link-4] for the very first time. (I did some liveblogging while I was there; [here's a list][link-1] of the liveblogs published from last year's Interop.) Fortunately, I was invited back again this year (very excited about that!), and as a returning speaker I recently had the opportunity to do a podcast with [Technology Advice][link-3] about SDN, virtualization, containers, and Interop.

You can listen to a copy of the podcast [here on SoundCloud][link-2].

Here are a few takeaways from my conversation on the podcast:

* _The term "SDN" is too much of a buzzword._ Companies are applying the "SDN" term to everything from using a Linux-based network operating system (NOS) on their hardware to adding APIs to existing proprietary NOSes or providing virtual appliances of their software. As a result, it's just become too vague.

* _Containers are a powerful tool._ Containers---in the form of Docker containers, LXC/LXD, or CoreOS rkt---can offer real benefits in some use cases. That being said...

* _Containers are not the answer to every problem._ This goes to the discussion I had on the podcast about "competing vs. complimentary" technologies. Containers can't---and honestly shouldn't try---to be the answer to all problems out there. Personally, I think one of the reasons Docker has been successful (so far) is due to their focus on workflow and making things easier for developers.

* _I'm pretty bullish on Interop._ I really like and enjoy the opportunity to mix and mingle with experts from different technology tracks. Perhaps I'll [see you there][link-5]?

Thanks to Interop and Technology Advice for the opportunity to participate on the podcast!
