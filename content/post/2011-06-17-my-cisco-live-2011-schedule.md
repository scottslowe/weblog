I'm very fortunate this year to have the opportunity to attend Cisco Live in Las Vegas. This will be my first year at Cisco Live and I'm really looking forward to taking in a lot of new information. I do plan on live-blogging and live-tweeting (is there any other kind of tweeting?) the event to provide as much coverage as possible for my readers.

With that in mind, here's my schedule for Cisco Live. When I'm not in sessions, I'll be at the EMC booth. At any point along the way, feel free to stop me and say hello. (And yes, if you have one of my VMware vSphere books with you, I'll be happy to sign it.)

That's my schedule as it currently stands. If anyone has any feedback on sessions that perhaps I should consider instead of the ones listed above, please let me know! There's so much information available in so many different sessions it was hard balancing all my interests. As it was I had about half a dozen sessions that I still wanted to attend but couldn't due to schedule conflicts.
