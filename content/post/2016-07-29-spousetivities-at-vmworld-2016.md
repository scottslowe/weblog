Many of you have asked, and here's the answer: Yes, there _will_ be [Spousetivities at VMworld 2016][link-1] in Las Vegas, NV! For those of you who may be new to the VMworld scene, Spousetivities started in 2008 when my wife got together with a small group of spouses and partners traveling with the conference attendees. From there, it's become a staple of the VMworld community events. Read on for more details on what's planned this year at [VMworld 2016][link-8]!

* First up is the famous "Getting to Know You" breakfast, but with a slightly different approach. This year you'll be cooking breakfast with [Chef Phillip Dell][link-2], winner of season 9 of "Chopped". How cool is that?
* There will be a walking tour of the Las Vegas Strip, in case there are folks that are new to Vegas.
* A trip to the Grand Canyon is available. If you haven't yet been to the Grand Canyon, this is a great way to go---private bus, meals along the way, etc. Much easier than planning such a trip yourself!
* Of course, you'll have the opportunity to see the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.
* Here's a new one: a 2-4 mile easy hike up Mount Charleston. Up at 7000 feet above sea level (that's about 2100 meters for all the metric-using folks out there), it will be a lot cooler than down on the Strip, and should offer some great views.
* If you really enjoyed cooking breakfast with Chef Dell, there will be another cooking class later in the week.

All in all, this is a **great** set of activities for anyone who may be traveling with a VMworld conference attendee. Spouses, domestic partners, girlfriends/boyfriends, family members---it doesn't matter, all are welcome to join in the activities.

Helping to keep the costs down on the activities are the Spousetivities sponsors, which this year include [VMware NSX][link-3], [The Virtualization Practice][link-4], [VMUG][link-5], and [Veeam][link-6].

If you're interested in getting signed up, please head over to [the VMworld 2016 Spousetivities registration page][link-7]. Don't delay though---it's common for activities to sell out.

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas!
