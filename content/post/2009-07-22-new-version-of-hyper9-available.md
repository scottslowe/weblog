Hyper9 is releasing a new version of their flagship virtualization management product, also of the same name, today. An official announcement of the release from Hyper9 is expected next week. The new version brings numerous enhancements to further expose its functionality to new users.

Among other new features---such as a refined search results list with new graphical indicators and a series of instructional videos to showcase the functionality of Hyper9--Hyper9 has added the "My Environment" section. This section of the interface includes a set of predefined queries that are intended to help new users more effectively and more quickly harness the power of Hyper9. Rather than needing to learn or use the query builder, new users can come here to quickly run, view, and save queries and query results.

Hyper9 is also shifting more effort toward helping end users uncover and control "VM sprawl," by including more predefined queries targeted at finding and identifying unused virtual machines that might have been used at one time but are now just taking up resources in the virtual environment. Examples of these sorts of queries include:

* Windows VMs that have not been logged into for more than 30 days
* VMs that are off or suspended
* VMs with inactive disk files (have not been modified for more than 30 days)

My only complaint with Hyper9 is that the interface, which is web-based, leverages Microsoft .Net components, thus limiting it to the Windows platform. Sorry, Linux and Mac OS X users---looks like you'll need a Windows VM to access Hyper9. _(Correction: Hyper9 has clarified that Mac OS X and Linux users should not have any problems accessing the Hyper9 web interface. Thanks for the clarification!)_
