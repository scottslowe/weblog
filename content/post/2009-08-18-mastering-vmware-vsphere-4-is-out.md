As many of you already know, since the beginning of the year I'd been working on a virtualization book, _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_. Today I received word from my publisher that the book has been officially released from the warehouse! **It's finally out!**

I can't tell you how excited I am about this release. It's been so much work, and now I'll finally get to see the fruits of my labor in real, physical form! As soon as I read the message from my editor I called my wife, Crystal ([follow her](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter). I think she's more excited than I am!

I'm sure there will be lots of questions about when Amazon will start shipping pre-orders. Although the book has been released from the publisher's warehouse, that doesn't necessarily mean that Amazon will start shipping out right away. I'm hoping that pre-orders will start shipping very soon, and as soon as I have more information I'll post something here on the site as well as post an update via Twitter (feel free to [follow me](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe) as well). As of right now, I don't have any firm information on when pre-orders will start shipping, so I can't really give you any dates. Sorry, folks!

Thanks to everyone who has helped raise awareness of the book and thanks to everyone who has already pre-ordered a copy. Your support has been tremendous! Feel free to continue to spread the word!
