The Omni Group just announced that [Beta 1 of OmniGraffle 5.1 is now available](http://blog.omnigroup.com/2008/08/20/omnigraffle-51-beta-1-is-now-available/), and with it comes a huge feature for me: importing and displaying Enhanced Metafiles in Visio documents!

This is huge because the vast majority of Visio shapes are stored as Enhanced Metafile images, and before now those images would not convert correctly into an OmniGraffle document. That made transferring complex network diagrams---a big part of my day job---a real hassle. With this new support, things should be much smoother sailing now.

Great job, Omni Group! Keep up the good work.
