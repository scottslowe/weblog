This edition of Virtualization Short Takes is mainly a collection of items from the VMworld 2008 conference in Las Vegas. Some of these are session transcripts from various bloggers; some are just VMworld-related blog posts.

* Blogger Rich Brambley has some great coverage of various VMworld sessions: [BC3819](http://vmetc.com/2008/09/16/re-architecting-data-protection-processes-with-data-deduplication-and-virtualization-technologies-bc3819/), [BC2370](http://vmetc.com/2008/09/19/enterprise-class-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery-and-management-for-vmware-esx-environments-bc2370/), [PO2575](http://vmetc.com/2008/09/19/deploying-vmware-in-a-linux-shop-po2575/), and [VD3261](http://vmetc.com/2008/09/20/vdi-versus-terminal-services-vd3261/), among others. Excellent work, Rich.

* The whole vStorage thing has prompted quite a flurry of attention. I'll probably tackle this myself soon, but for now I'll just comment on what others are saying. Stephen Foskett [comments](http://blog.fosketts.net/2008/09/19/what-vmware-vdc-os-vstorage/) that "VDC-OS has legs!", meaning that this vision has some substance behind it; I agree. He also has a nice collection of related vStorage links. There's also [Chad's discussion of vStorage](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2008/09/so-what-does-vs.html), which is quite helpful coming as it does from the perspective of a storage vendor seeking to take advantage of these new capabilities. Mark Twomey also had [a little bit to say](http://storagezilla.typepad.com/storagezilla/2008/09/powerpath-for-vmware-and-a-few-random-thoughts.html) about vStorage as well.

* Michael Keen's [VMworld 2008 analysis](http://www.brianmadden.com/blog/MichaelKeen/VMWorld-2008-My-analysis-and-review) provides a good review of VMware's announcements and strategy in relation to the competition and the partner and the partner ecosystem.

* UK magazine _Computing_ [was disappointed](http://newsdesk.computing.co.uk/2008/09/virtually-disap.html) by Paul Maritz's vision and the VDC-OS announcement, expecting "more granular details on how the initiative would actually take off." Personally, I felt that [Steve Herrod's keynote on Day 2][1] did a fairly reasonable job of showing the mechanics behind Paul's vision.

* Redmond Developer News provided [another view of VMware's VDC-OS announcement](http://reddevnews.com/news/article.aspx?editorialsid=10197), although to be honest the article looked pretty much like every other discussion of VDC-OS, with the same interviews of the same people.

* Kevin Fogarty's take on the VDC-OS pitch, [published on CIO.com](http://cio.com/article/449670/VMware_Chief_Fails_Credibility_Test_in_Virtual_Data_Center_OS_Pitch) originally, then [republished by Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Operating+Systems&articleId=9115043&taxonomyId=89&pageNumber=1) and [touched upon briefly](http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2008/09/vmwares-virtual-data-center-os-pitch.html) by Tarry Singh, is that it's "too much of a leap of faith for me and, I suspect, most of the VMware faithful as well." I get that VMware's new strategy is radically different from anything VMware has done before; up until now, their releases have been product-focused. Now Maritz is driving the company with a long-term vision that will be fulfilled through a series of product releases. It's a shift in thinking, and one that will require an adjustment. Personally, I don't like the new VDC-OS branding and I told VMware straight up that it would be confusing to customers. Nevertheless, the vision behind the brand is, in my opinion, solid and so I must disagree with Kevin's analysis.

* Massimo [thinks Paul plagiarized](http://it20.info/blogs/main/archive/2008/09/21/143.aspx) the VDC-OS concept. If he were serious (which he's not), he actually has a pretty good case.

* Eric Sloof has [a bit](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/666-Cisco-Nexus-1000V-Virtual-Switch.html) of additional Cisco Nexus 1000V coverage.

I think that about wraps up my collection of VMworld 2008-related links. If I've missed anything significant---and I'm sure I have---please feel free to add it in the comments.
