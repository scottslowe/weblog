That's right, VMware has finally settled on a new name for would have been called VMware Infrastructure 4. The new name? **VMware vSphere.**

Word is already out via several other bloggers, such as [Jason Boche](http://www.boche.net/blog/?p=720), [Rich Brambley](http://vmetc.com/2008/12/19/vmware-virtual-infrastructure-to-be-renamed-vsphere/), and [Rick Scherer](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2008/12/19/the-new-name-for-vmware-virtual-infrastructure/).

This is just the next step in a series of product renames: Virtual Desktop Manager becomes VMware View, VirtualCenter becomes vCenter Server, etc.

Personally, I very much wished they had selected one of the other names they were tossing around. I liked "VMware Vantage." vSphere? Who came up with this name, and what in the world is this supposed to mean? To me, it creates connotations of running around in a circle getting nowhere. Not exactly the image we want to create, is it?

Anyway, that's why VMware doesn't pay me to think. In fact, they don't pay me at all! Time will tell whether this was a brilliant marketing move or the beginning of the end. Feel free to tell me what you think in the comments.

**UPDATE:** I'm writing a book on vSphere! [Check out the details here.][1]
