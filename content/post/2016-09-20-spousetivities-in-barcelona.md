If you're going to be in Barcelona for either [VMworld EMEA][link-7] (running the week of October 17) or [the fall 2016 OpenStack Summit][link-8] (running the week of October 24), then I recommend you plan for your spouse/partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/whatever to join you for what I believe are some pretty spectacular Spousetivities.

## VMworld EMEA

First, let's have a quick look at the activities planned around [VMworld EMEA][link-7]. What's in store? Here's a quick sneak peek (check out [the registration page][link-1] for full details):

* Sailing the Mediterranean off the coast of Barcelona
* A casual 3-hour bike tour of Barcelona with tapas
* Walking tour of Barcelona with wine and food tastings
* A visit to Montserrat, with an opportunity to hear the famed Boys' Choir and see one of the black Madonnas of Europe
* A full-day trip to the French Pyrenees for a mix of Catalan, Spanish, and French culture
* A full-day tour of Roman Tarragona and a visit to the Cistercian monastery of El Poblet

Tickets for all these events are [available now][link-1]. These events were sponsored by [VMware NSX][link-3], [Veeam][link-4], [VMUG][link-5], and [TVP Strategy][link-6].

## OpenStack Summit Barcelona

If you're coming to Barcelona for the [OpenStack Summit][link-8] instead (or perhaps staying over after VMworld EMEA), there's a great week of activities planned that week as well, all sponsored by [VMware NSX][link-3]. Here's a quick run-down:

* Barcelona food and wine tour
* Biking tour of Barcelona with some delicious tapas for lunch
* A trip to Montserrat with wine tastings afterward
* A visit to the Pyrenese mountain village of Rupit (not to be missed!)
* Hiking the cliffs and coves of Catalunya
* A tour of the medieval walled city of Giorna
* Roman Tarragona and the El Poblet Cistercian monastery

Tickets for these events are also [available now][link-2].

As you can see, there's some overlap between the two weeks, but there is still more than enough to keep anyone busy for both weeks!
