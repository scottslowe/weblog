While at VMware Partner Exchange 2008 in San Diego this week, a few virtualization- or VMware-related headlines have popped in and caught my attention:

* [Via Eric](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/452-vimsh-for-ESX-3.5.html), I learned that vimsh has morphed into vmware-vim-cmd in version 3.5. [Xtravirt's updated document](http://www.xtravirt.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=125&Itemid=88) can be found here.

* [Via Duncan](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2008/05/02/new-esxi-35-patches/), it looks as if a number of patches for ESX/ESXi 3.5 have been released. Time to put Update Manager through its paces...

* As several other bloggers have mentioned, VMware is now discussing in much greater detail the VMware Certified Design Expert (VCDX) certification. I suspect that the BC/DR and VI architectural workshops that are taking place at Partner Exchange this week---which incorporate a fairly intensive review and presentation process---are prepping professionals for the rigors they will have to endure to achieve VCDX. Bring it on!

* Sys-Con Media---which has republished a couple of my articles---published [this interesting article](http://www.sys-con.com/read/558153.htm) from a KVM developer regarding the placement and architecture of I/O and I/O drivers in various virtualization solutions. Of course, he feels that KVM is the best, but that's not necessarily surprising.

* Author David Davis has published a [brief blog entry](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1311518,00.html?track=NL-923&ad=638169&asrc=EM_NLN_3563387&uid=4748370) at SearchVMware.com that summarizes the use of NIC teaming and load balancing with VMware ESX Server. This blog post is particularly useful since it references some of my own content.

In a future post, I'll probably delve into more detail an interesting and thought-provoking article from DCS titled ["Microsoft Unveils GSNW 2.0"](http://dcsblog.burtongroup.com/data_center_strategies/2008/05/microsoft-unvei.html). It's an interesting take on the (possible) repetition of history. In the meantime, I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this article---go read it, then come back here and add your thoughts in the comments below.
