title: 'Looking Ahead: My 2016 Projects'

Almost every year since 2012, I've been publishing a list of projects/goals for the upcoming year (here's [the original list for 2012][xref-1], [then 2013][xref-2], I skipped 2014, and here's [the list for 2015][xref-3]). In this post, I'm going to share with you the list of projects/goals for 2016.

Here's the list for 2016. For some of the items below, I'm also going to include a _stretch goal_, something I'll aim toward but won't count against myself if I don't actually attain it.

1. **Complete a new book (again).** In addition to _actually_ completing [the new network automation book][xref-5] I'm writing with Jason Edelman and Matt Oswalt (it's [available now as an Early Access edition][link-1]), I have another book project lined up that I intend to finish and get published in 2016.

2. **Make more open source contributions.** I failed this one miserably last year (see [last year's report card][xref-4]), but I am intent on making this one happen. Over time, I expect that this will just be part of who I am, but until then I'm going to explicitly call it out. Since I'm not a programmer (not yet, may never be), these contributions will have to take the form of documentation or similar areas.

3. **Expand my knowledge and use of Python.** I learned in 2012 that the synergy of the projects does make a difference. Given the role of Python in a number of open source projects ([OpenStack][link-2], for example) and the increasing use of Python in network automation, I feel like expanding my knowlege and use of Python is a worthy application of my time. _(Stretch goal: make a code contribution to a Python-based open source project.)_

4. **Expand my knowledge, use, and focus on public cloud services.** It's pretty clear that the use of public cloud services---whether from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or others---isn't going to go away or decrease. This year, I will spend time, energy, and focus becoming more familiar with using (and architecting designs for) public cloud services. _(Stretch goal: attain a certification in public cloud services, like AWS Certified Solutions Architect.)_

5. **Complete a "wildcard project."** As I said in the 2015 project list, the purpose of including this item here is because I don't know what lies ahead. Having this project gives me freedom to explore as new projects, new technologies, and new ideas emerge over the course of 2016.

What I've _not_ included in this list are things like continuing to blog (which I will most certainly do), continue with [my new podcast, the Full Stack Journey][xref-6] (which I will most certainly do), and continue to give back wherever possible (through [sharing materials on GitHub][link-3], by speaking at conferences and events, or by participating in mentorship programs like [vSensei][link-4]---all of which I will most certainly do).

Anyway, there you have it. Feel free to [contact me on Twitter][link-5] if you have any feedback (positive or negative) or questions.
