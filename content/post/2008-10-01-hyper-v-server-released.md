Microsoft announced the release of Hyper-V Server 2008 today via a [blog post](http://blogs.technet.com/stbnewsbytes/archive/2008/10/01/microsoft-hyper-v-server-2008-and-virtualization-services-certifications-and-training-offerings-now-available.aspx) on the Server and Tools Business News Bytes blog (man, is that a mouthful!). Available "later today" as a free download, Hyper-V Server is Microsoft's "bare metal" hypervisor-based virtualization product. Although the blog post said later today, I tried downloading it right away anyway, but the download link apparently doesn't yet work.

&lt;aside&gt;I don't know that it can really be called a "bare metal" virtualization solution since it still does require Windows Server 2008, albeit a heavily stripped-down version, in the parent partition in order to provide I/O drivers.&lt;/aside&gt;

Hyper-V Server 2008 can be [downloaded here](http://www.microsoft.com/servers/hyper-v-server/default.mspx).

Technical resources for Hyper-V Server 2008 can be [found here](http://www.microsoft.com/servers/hyper-v-server/technical-resources.mspx).
