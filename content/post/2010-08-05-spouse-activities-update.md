(Note: This is a guest post by my wife, Crystal, who is organizing spouse activities for VMworld. This is the third consecutive year for VMworld spouse activities and I'm happy to help support her efforts.)

[VMworld 2010](http://www.vmworld.com) in San Francisco, CA, is right around the corner! I'm excited about the activities planned for VMworld this year and I wanted to give you a quick update on activities planning and deadlines. Make a note of these deadlines---you don't want to miss out!

* Today, August 5, is **the last day to register** for the "Islands of San Francisco Bay" tour. Many of you might have looked at this entry on the [Spousetivities registration site](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/) and not realized that this is a tour of Alcatraz and Angel Island. Sorry for not being clearer! Here's why you should consider registering for this activity. First, this activity includes private transportation between the San Francisco Marriott (very near Moscone, where the conference is being held) and Pier 33. Second, this activity also includes a boxed lunch to enjoy on Angel Island. Third, you'll also get an expert guide from Organized Chaos (my partner in helping arrange some of these tours). Finally, a $50 discount is available for the first 20 people to e-mail me (see [the About page](http://spousetivities.com/about) for my e-mail address) and request the discount code. Having done the Alcatraz/Angel Island combination tour myself in previous years, I'd much prefer this private tour. Yes, it is a bit more expensive than the standard public tours, but the public tours don't include private transportation to and from the conference hotel area, lunch, or an expert guide. So, if you're interested, e-mail me for the discount code and then [go register](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/)!

* If you are interested in the Monterey/Carmel/Hearst Castle event, I've managed to get the deadline to register for this event extended to **tomorrow, Friday, August 6**. (Last time I checked the registration site still listed July 30.) This is a fantastic opportunity for couples to get away before the conference starts and enjoy some great scenery and sites! This awesome two-day event includes private transportation, catered reception-style dinner the night of the first day, overnight accommodations in San Simeon, breakfast and lunch on day two, private tour of Hearst Castle, and professional staff from Organized Chaos to coordinate the entire event. Definitely something to consider for couples interested in some private time before the madness of the conference!

* Don't forget that free lunch on the Muir Woods/Sausalito or the House Boat tours is available for people who respond to [my earlier post](http://spousetivities.com/2010/07/did-you-say-free/) so don't delay!

* As I've mentioned before, all the activities listed on the [Spousetivities registration site](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/) include private transportation, and many of them include a private lunch as well. These are goodies that aren't included in the typical public tours.

Don't forget that all registrants for spouse activities will get a free T-shirt (last year's shirts were a HUGE hit!), free welcome breakfast, and a nice gift bag with some goodies inside. All these freebies are courtesy of our sponsors this year: [EMC](http://www.emc.com), [Train Signal](http://www.trainsignal.com), and [HyTrust](http://www.hytrust.com).

Act now if you're interested in some of these activities! If you have questions, contact me on Twitter (my Twitter ID is [@spousetivities](http://twitter.com/spousetivities)) or drop me an e-mail. Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you in San Francisco!
