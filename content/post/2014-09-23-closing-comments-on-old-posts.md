One of the great things about this site is the interaction I enjoy with readers. It's always great to get comments from readers about how an article was informative, answered a question, or helped solve a problem. Knowing that what I've written here is helpful to others is a _very_ large part of why I've been writing here for over 9 years.

Until today, I've left comments (and sometimes trackbacks) open on very old blog posts. Just the other day I received a comment on a 4 year old article where a reader was sharing another way to solve the same problem. Unfortunately, that has to change. Comment spam on the site has grown considerably over the last few months, despite the use of a number of plugins to help address the issue. It's no longer just an annoyance; it's now a problem.

As a result, starting today, all blog posts more than 3 years old will automatically have their comments and trackbacks closed. I hate to do it---really I do---but I don't see any other solution to the increasing blog spam.

I hope that this does not adversely impact my readers' ability to interact with me, but it is a necessary step.

Thanks to all who continue to read this site. I do sincerely appreciate your time and attention, and I hope that I can continue to provide useful and relevant content to help make peoples' lives better.
