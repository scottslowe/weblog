title: Saying Goodbye to the Full Stack Journey

In January 2016, I published [the first-ever episode][link-1] of the Full Stack Journey podcast. In October 2023, [the last-ever episode][link-2] of the Full Stack Journey podcast was published. After almost seven years and 83 episodes, it was time to end my quirky, eclectic, and unusual podcast that explored career journeys alongside various technologies, products, and open source projects. In this post, I wanted to share a few thoughts about saying goodbye to the Full Stack Journey.<!--more-->

First and foremost, let me say that I really enjoyed being the host of the Full Stack Journey podcast---far more than I expected I would, if I'm honest. While I didn't love the logistics of producing a podcast, I _did_ love getting to talk with folks, hear their stories, and learn about new things. So, while part of me is thankful to have a little less work to do, another part---a larger part---is sad to see it end.

That being said, some of you are probably wondering why it ended. I mentioned that I didn't enjoy the logistics of producing a podcast; specifically, I didn't enjoy audio editing. Some folks like it, but I didn't. It was truly a chore for me. That was why I joined the Packet Pushers podcast network---they offered to provide that logistical support in exchange for the opportunity to try to monetize the podcast. (And if I'm honest, I have mad respect for both Greg and Ethan. You might say I'm a bit of a fanboy. Any chance to be associated with them in some form was not to be missed.) The truth, though, is the podcast just didn't resonate with sponsors. I get it; I do. It was a bit of an odd podcast. Not quite career-focused, not quite technology-focused, but something unusual that fell somewhere in between. When all was said and done, it wasn't financially feasible for Packet Pushers to continue to support the podcast. I bear no ill will toward Greg, Ethan, or any of the rest of the Packet Pushers crew; they were, are, and will remain top notch in my book. If you ever get the opportunity to meet them, work with them, or be a guest on one of their podcasts, take the opportunity. You won't regret it.

What's next? I honestly don't know. I've toyed with the idea of launching another podcast, and I've toyed with the idea of joining a podcast as a co-host. I've contemplated creating some video content, since that seems to be rather popular. I don't know. If you have a suggestion for me to consider, feel free to hit me up; I'm around on a variety of social media channels and other community spots.

Regardless of what I decide to do, I will always look fondly on my time hosting Full Stack Journey. To those of you who listened to least one of the shows, thank you; to those of you who were guests, I couldn't have done it without you---you're the real stars of the show. Hosting Full Stack Journey was definitely a journey itself, and it's one that I'm thankful I took.
