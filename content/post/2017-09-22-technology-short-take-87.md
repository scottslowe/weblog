title: "Technology Short Take 87"

Welcome to Technology Short Take #87! I have a mix of newer and older items for you this time around. While I'm a bit short on links in some areas, hopefully this is outweighed by some good content in other areas. Here's hoping you find something useful!<!--more-->

## Networking

* Vincent Bernat has a really in-depth article on [IPv4 route lookup on Linux][link-12] (and [one on IPv6 route lookup][link-13] as well).
* Ivan Pepelnjak has [a great article][link-17] that tries to get to the kernel of truth in the middle of the intent-based networking hype.
* Jason Edelman of Network2Code also has a post on [intent-based network automation with Ansible][link-22], in which he breaks down the idea of intent-based networking (IBN) and how tools such as Ansible or NAPALM can make it possible.
* From the Department of "Sitting in my Inbox for Way Too Long", I wanted to point out a company that I ran into back in May of this year at the OpenStack Summit in Boston. The company is [VirTool Networks][link-18] (catchy, eh?), and their product (VirTool Network Analyzer) is aimed at providing some operational visibility into OpenStack virtual networks. I saw a demo of the product---it looks quite handy, and provides a pretty fair amount of information to help operators figure out what's happening "under the covers." If your shop is into OpenStack, you might want to give this tool a look.
* Ajay Chenampara (also with Network2Code) has a good post on [lessons learned from interacting with NETCONF and YANG][link-32] (key lesson: there's two ways to use NETCONF, and one of them doesn't involve YANG).

## Servers/Hardware

Nothing this time around, but stay tuned for something next time.

## Security

* Chris Binnie walks you through the process of [using user namespaces to help secure your Docker hosts and containers][link-2].
* Joep Piscaer discusses his use of ProtonVPN as [an always-on VPN for his home network][link-5].
* Sadequl Hussain has [an introduction to basic concepts in SELinux][link-14] that may be worth reading if you're unfamiliar with SELinux (as it seems many people are).
* Virtue Security has some articles on AWS penetration testing: [one on S3 buckets][link-26] and [one that also covers IAM and EC2][link-27].

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Alexander Holbreich has a write-up on [how to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu][link-1].
* Corey Quinn dives into some of [the "secret sauce" behind Amazon Route 53][link-15]; specifically, health checks and traffic policies.
* Ádám Sándor has launched a blog series ([chapter 1 is available][link-19] now) that mirrors Kelsey Hightower's [Kubernetes the Hard Way tutorial on GitHub][link-20]. I'm looking forward to future chapters in this series.
* The folks over at Cloudify recently did a survey on the state of "enterprise multi-cloud"; the report is available [here][link-21] (doesn't appear to be behind a paywall/regwall). A few interesting things jumped out at me from the report; one of them was regarding an increase in "siloism" as organizations embraced multiple clouds. Anyway, you may find the report interesting.
* AWS goes to [per-second billing][link-23] for EC2 instances and EBS volumes.
* Massimo Re Ferre has a great article discussing [VMware Cloud on AWS versus Azure Stack][link-24] and breaking down the differences between the two approaches.

## Operating Systems/Applications

* [RIP Solaris][link-3].
* Chris Collins [takes a deeper look at Buildah][link-4], a tool for building container images (including Docker-compatible container images).
* Dusty Mabe has a multi-part blog series on Atomic Host. The series starts with [part 0][link-6] (preparation), and continues with [part 1][link-7] (mostly about `rpm-ostree`), [part 2][link-8] (container storage), [part 3][link-9] (rebase, upgrade, and rollback), [part 4][link-10] (package layering and experimental features), and [part 5][link-11] (containerized and non-containerized applications). There's a ton of information in this series!
* Ryan Lane provides a fairly in-depth overview of [why Lyft uses SaltStack for AWS orchestration instead of Terraform][link-16]. Lane makes some great points, but I think it's also really important to highlight that this decision also comes with the burden of maintaining custom Python state modules and other code. This isn't a bad thing; it's just something to consider if you or your organization is considering a similar choice.
* Andrew Montalenti [discusses the state of Linux on the desktop][link-28] by examining his own journey with various Lenovo-branded laptops.
* I recently used a variation of the information in [this article][link-31] to keep OTR private keys in sync among a group of OS X-based systems.

## Storage

* I wouldn't normally include this sort of link, but I know that I personally have benefited from J Metz' storage knowledge so this seems like a reasonable way of returning the favor (he was a huge help me to "back in the day" when I was writing [FCoE posts][xref-1]). J has launched [a Patreon page][link-33] to help drive funding to enable him to create new storage-related content. If storage is your thing, have a look and see if this is something that makes sense for you.

## Virtualization

* John Kozej walks through [how to configure vCenter HA using the NSX load balancer][link-25].
* Ivan Pepelnjak [speaks frankly about VMware Cloud on AWS][link-30]. (And don't you just love the new design on his site?)

## Career/Soft Skills

* Julia Evans has a good post on [how to answer questions well][link-29].

Alright, it's time to wrap up now. I hope you've found something useful, and look for the next Technology Short Take in about 2 weeks.
