I don't know that I necessarily agree with his viewpoint, but in ["A fake freedom"](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7977?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550), the question is raised: Do we really own our data?

Are the pictures uploaded to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) still yours? What about the bookmarks you've posted on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)? Or the weblog entries on a free weblog service such as [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/)? You think so? Says who?

Truly paranoid people could be worried that these services might maintain copies of their information, even after the user has requested that they be deleted. Of course, if you are really worried about copies of stuff, you may want to think about the [Google](http://www.google.com/) cache...

At the very least, it would probably be a good idea to keep copies of this kind of information somewhere other than these "free" services. Otherwise, you just never know when a site may suddenly go dark, so to speak, for any number of reasons.
