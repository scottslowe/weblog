[VMworld][link-2] is upon us, and if you've been to the conference before you know it can sometimes be challenging to catch up with folks. (If this is your first time, now you know it can sometimes be challenging to catch up with folks.) This post is an effort to help make it a bit easier if you're interested in meeting up with me at VMworld.

In years past, I published my schedule so that others could see what sessions I was attending, find times we could meet, etc. Now that I'm a VMware employee, registering for sessions is not permitted (customers first, as it should be!). However, it may still be helpful to show my schedule, so I'm listing it below. You can also [view a read-only version of my calendar here][link-1].

If you're interested in catching up to talk tech, ask a question, share something cool you've found or done, or just say hi, I have a number of spots open. Just drop me an e-mail (my address is on this site---it's not too hard to find) and let me know if there's a day and time that would work for you. I'm happy to do my best to accommodate all reasonable requests. You're also welcome to try to find me in the VMvillage, where I'll likely spend a fair bit of time when I'm not booked for something else.

(Vendors, please note: taking a meeting with you does _not_ automatically mean I'll blog about your product/technology/solution. I might, and I might not.)

As I mentioned earlier, you can access [a read-only version of my schedule via your browser][link-1], if that makes it easier for you.

I look forward to speaking with you at VMworld!
