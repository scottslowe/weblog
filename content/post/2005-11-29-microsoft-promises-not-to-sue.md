[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) recently made a move to "open" up its XML-based file formats for Microsoft Office 2003 and the forthcoming Office 12. These file formats were offered to ECMA International for consideration as a formal open standard. However, the "license" for these file formats was merely a promise not to sue people violating its patents on the use of the file formats.

Also see [these comments](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1892757,00.asp) from a legal analyst regarding Microsoft's [Patent Protection Covenant](http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx).

Personally, a promise "not to sue" from any large corporation---not just Microsoft---wouldn't be good enough for me were I a developer. Somehow, I don't think that many developers are going to feel completely comfortable incorporating Office 2003/12 XML-based file formats into their applications based solely on the Patent Protection Covenant. What happens when (not if) the covenant changes?
