I'm getting ready to start a "Virtual Networking 101" series of blog posts, where I'm going to try to help introduce the ideas and concepts of virtual networking to VM admins that might not be familiar with these concepts. These are not deep dives; rather, I'm aiming to provide enough introductory knowledge that VM admins are who aren't familiar with this stuff can at least understand what's going on. However, I've been working in this stuff for a little while now, so it's a bit difficult for me to tell what core/base concepts would really be helpful to others.

In that vein, then, I'm asking for you-the readers-to let me know: what core/base concepts of virtual networking would _you_ find most helpful? I'm initially thinking of topics like OpenFlow or network overlays, but what would you find helpful? What topics do you want to see or would find useful? Speak up in the comments below to let me know your thoughts. Thanks!
