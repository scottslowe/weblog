[DockerCon 2017][link-1] is coming up in mid-April in Austin, TX, and [Spousetivities][link-4] will once again be offering activities for folks traveling to Austin with conference attendees. This is Spousetivities' second time at DockerCon, and Crystal has a great lineup of activities planned.

Here's a quick preview of the activities organized for DockerCon:

* Trip to Magnolia Market (from HGTV's "Fixer Upper")
* Tour of LBJ State Park
* Visit to Fredricksburg
* Sightseeing through the Hill Country around Austin
* Lunch at the Salt Lick BBQ

Austin in the spring should be a great place to visit, and Crystal has some really enjoyable activities planned---it's a great reason to bring your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, significant other, or family member with you to Austin when you come for DockerCon. Of course, the chance to win some great prizes is nice too...

Crystal's [blog post on the Spousetivities site][link-2] has a few more details, and [registration is open right now][link-3].
