_(This is a repost of [an announcement](http://spousetivities.com/2014/07/giving-back-to-the-community/) from the Spousetivities web site. I wanted to include it here for broader coverage. --Scott)_

For seven years, Spousetivities has been fortunate to be part of the VMware/[VMworld](http://www.vmworld.com/index.jspa) community. Since 2008, we've been the _only_ community-focused and community-driven spouse activities program, and it's been an honor. Spousetivities exists thanks to the support of the community. However, Spousetivities also exists to provide support back to that same community.

Last week, a member of our community was tragically taken from us. Jim Ruddy died in a car accident, leaving behind his wife Stephanie and their children. This is a horrible loss, and the community continues to mourn his loss. (My husband, Scott, worked with Jim at EMC for a number of years, as did many others.) In honor of Jim and to support the family he left behind, I worked with other members of the community to establish [the Jim Ruddy Memorial Fund](https://www.crowdrise.com/fundraise-and-volunteer/donations/jimruddymemorialfund/crystallowe). As of this writing, that fund had raised over $15,000 to help support Stephanie and the kids in this very trying time.

No amount of money can replace Jim. However, this is a difficult time for Stephanie---not only emotionally and physically, but also financially. For that reason, **Spousetivities is setting aside 10% of all proceeds raised by activities at VMworld 2014 to be donated to Jim Ruddy's family via the Jim Ruddy Memorial Fund.**

If you haven't donated to [the Jim Ruddy Memorial Fund](https://www.crowdrise.com/fundraise-and-volunteer/donations/jimruddymemorialfund/crystallowe) yet, please consider doing so. If you (or your spouse/partner/significant other) is participating in Spousetivities at VMworld this year, please know that your participation means also helping a family in their time of need.

Being part of the community means giving back to the community.
