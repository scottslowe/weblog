In case there was any question whether [Spousetivities][link-2] would be present at VMworld 2018, let this settle it for you: Spousetivities **will** be there! In fact, [registration for Spousetivities at VMworld 2018 is already open][link-1]. If previous years are any indication, there's a really good possibility these activities will sell out. Better get your tickets sooner rather than later!<!--more-->

This year's activities are funded in part by the generous and community-minded support of [Veeam][link-5], [ActualTech Media][link-3], [Datrium][link-4], and [VMUG][link-6].

Here's a brief peek at what's planned for VMworld in Las Vegas this August:

## Monday, August 27

* It's a tradition to kick the week off with a Welcome/"Getting to Know You" breakfast, and this year---year 11 for Spousetivities at VMworld---is no different! There will be great food, great company, and the opportunity to win some cool prizes.
* On Monday afternoon you can secure a spot in a private pod on the High Roller, including an open bar. Nice!
* Monday is also the first of three (yes, _three_) cabana days by the pool. This is the perfect way to relax by the Mandalay Bay pool! Monday's cabana day is sponsored by [ActualTech Media][link-3].

## Tuesday, August 28

* On Tuesday, Spousetivities participants will head to Zion National Park. I went to Zion earlier this year, and let me tell you---it is _absolutely_ amazing. Don't miss this trip if you enjoy spectacular natural views.
* A cabana day is available for those who would prefer to relax by the pool and catch some sun. Tuesday's cabana day is also brought to you by [ActualTech Media][link-3].

## Wednesday, August 29

* The third and final cabana day is available on Wednesday. Haven't had your chance in the sun yet, or can't get enough time by the pool? No worries, you still have another chance! Wednesday's cabana day is sponsored by [Datrium][link-4].
* For those seeking a different kind of adventure, how about an ATV adventure through the Valley of Fire? This sounds like so much fun, and the Spousetivities price is nearly 50% off the retail price.

## Thursday, August 30

Thursday's sole activity is a walking food tour, available with or without specialty cocktails. Don't worry: if you partied hard at the official event party the previous evening, this event doesn't start until noon, so you have time to recover.

Head on over to [the registration page][link-1] to get more information about any of the activities, or to sign up. Remember that although it's called "Spousetivities," anyone is welcome! You don't have to be a spouse to attend.

What are you waiting for? Go sign up now!
