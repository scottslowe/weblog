Long-time readers of my site know that my wife, Crystal, launched what is now known as [Spousetivities][link-1] at VMworld 2008. Since that time, she's been able to organize activities for hundreds of companions at dozens of events around the world. This year she's adding another event to the roster: [DockerCon 2016][link-2] in Seattle!

That's right, Crystal and Spousetivities will be available at DockerCon in Seattle. Here's a quick look at some of the things she's got planned:

* Morning yoga on both Monday and Tuesday (both days of the conference), led by a Docker employee
* Food tour plus a visit to Woodland Park Zoo (great option for attendees traveling with kids)
* Tours of Seattle on both Monday and Tuesday, including stops at the Space Needle, Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, and the Kerry Park scenic overlook.
* Wine and chocolate tastings plus a visit to Sqonalmie Falls

All in all, it sounds like a great set of activities. Also, I'm very impressed that DockerCon is also [offering childcare during the event][link-4]. Between Spousetivities offering kid-friendly events both days and DockerCon providing childcare, there's no reason not to bring the family with you to Seattle.

If you're interested in signing up for any of the activities Crystal has planned, visit [the Spousetivities registration page][link-3]. I'll see you in Seattle!
