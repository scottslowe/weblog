Somewhat in conjunction with the [Citrix XenServer 5 announcement][1], Citrix is also today announcing Citrix Cloud Center, a new product family that is intended to allow enterprise to take better advantage of cloud-based services, both internal to the enterprise as well as external to the enterprise.

Part of this product suite is XenServer Cloud Edition, a version of XenServer optimized for service provider environments. This version of XenServer is also intended to provide a direct upgrade path for cloud providers that may currently be using the open source Xen hypervisor. Also in the Cloud Center product suite are NetScaler for application optimization within the cloud, WANScaler to provide a "bridge" between internal enterprise and external hosted clouds, and Workflow Studio to link the products together in an automated fashion.

Citrix Cloud Center is available immediately.
