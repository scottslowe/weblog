The next meeting of the Triangle Area VMware User Group will be next Thursday, December 10, 2009, from 11:30AM to 2PM. The meeting will be held at RTP Organization in Building 18/1807 at 104 TW Alexander Drive in Research Triangle Park. A map of the location (courtesy of Google Maps) is available [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=104+T.W.+Alexander+Drive,+Research+Triangle+Park,+NC+27709&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=37.871902,47.373047&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=104+Alexander+Dr,+Durham,+North+Carolina+27713&ll=35.897116,-78.879797&spn=0.009473,0.011566&z=16&iwloc=A), and a schedule/agenda of the meeting is available [here](http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmug/us-southeast/raleigh).

I will be presenting at the meeting during a "Stump the Expert" (or maybe it should be "Stump the vExpert"?) session at the end of the meeting. I insisted that it wouldn't be very hard to stump this vExpert; if you don't believe me, go back and watch the video from the Ask The Experts VMworld sessions. Nevertheless, I appreciate the opportunity to join VMware, Veeam, and local users during the meeting and I hope that I'll be able to provide some useful information.

I hope to see you there!
