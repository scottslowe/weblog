Some time ago, [Mac OS X Hints](http://www.macosxhints.com/) published a hint I submitted regarding the [use of the `.local` TLD](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040806232315819) (top level domain) with Mac OS X. Specifically, the hint centered around the use of Mac OS X with Active Directory domains using the `.local` TLD. For ease of access, here's that same hint.

Basically, Mac OS X uses the `.local` TLD for Bonjour/Rendezvous services, and is configured to use [multicast DNS (mDNS)](http://www.multicastdns.org/) for discovery of those services. This configuration occurs via a file named `local` in the `/etc/resolver` directory. Apple's Knowledge Base article offers a solution, but that solution involves editing this `local` file, which affects Bonjour/Rendezvous operation. This solution, on the other hand, does not affect the `local` file in any way, and thus does not interfere with Bonjour/Rendezvous.

Let's say that you need to integrate Mac OS X with an Active Directory domain called _company.local._ Simply create a file in `/etc/resolver` named `company.local` with the following contents:

```text
nameserver a.b.c.d
nameserver w.x.y.z
port 53
```

Obviously, replace the letters in the text above with the IP addresses of your appropriate DNS servers for the company.local Active Directory domain. Then, flush the lookupd cache with `lookupd -flushcache` and that's it!

With this file in place, your Mac OS X system will resolve _company.local_ (or _subdomain.company.local_) via the instructions in the file `/etc/resolver/company.local`, but will handle Bonjour/Rendezvous service discovery via mDNS in the same fashion.
