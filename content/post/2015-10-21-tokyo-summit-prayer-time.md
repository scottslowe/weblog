title: Prayer Time at Tokyo Summit

This is something I've had the pleasure of organizing at VMworld over the last couple of years, and I'd like to start doing it at the OpenStack Summits as well. So, next week in Tokyo, I'd like to offer Christians attending the Summit the opportunity to gather together for a brief time of prayer before the day's activities get started.

If you're interested in attending, here are the details.

**What:** A brief time of prayer  

**Where:** The koi pond outside the Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa (the koi pond in front of the orange building on [the Summit campus map][link-1])

**When:** Tuesday, October 27 through Thursday, October 29, at 8:00 am each day (this should give you time to grab some breakfast before the keynotes and sessions start at 9:00 am)

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note that this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity. This is not to exclude anyone, but rather to focus on like-minded individuals. (I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities.)

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the Summit, and the other attendees gathered there

You don't need to RSVP to let me know you'll be there, although you can if you'd like. You also don't need to bring anything except your faith and an open heart. This is intended to be a very casual gathering of believers---we'll meet, share some requests and needs, and say a few words of prayer over each other and over the event.

I look forward to meeting you there!

**UPDATE:** It turns out the pool I had originally chosen isn't accessible to the general public, so we need to move the location. I've updated the post to reflect that we are now meeting at the koi pond directly in front of the Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa (building #4, the orange building on the Summit map).
