In just a few short weeks, VMware users throughout the Carolinas and surrounding areas will be gathering once more in Charlotte, NC, for the annual Carolina VMware Users Summit. As usual, friend and industry expert [Mike Laverick](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/) will be on hand to speak.

&lt;aside&gt;You like how I dubbed Mike Laverick an industry expert? It turns out---based on the timeless wisdom of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)---that you only need an existing industry expert to refer to you as an industry expert and you're good to go. And since others referred to me as an industry expert, I'm passing the favor along to Mike!&lt;/aside&gt;

All joking aside, it is shaping up to be quite an event. I believe that in addition to Mike Laverick, we're also expecting [Mike DiPetrillo](http://www.mikedipetrillo.com/) of VMware, Rich Brambley of Veeam (and of [VM /ETC](http://vmetc.com) and [Virtumania](http://vmetc.com/podcast/) fame), and fellow VCDX [Jason Nash](http://jasonnash.wordpress.com/) of local reseller [Varrow](http://www.varrow.com/). I've also been invited to speak, so I'll be on hand as well.

With a great lineup of breakout sessions, panel discussions, and keynotes, and a great lineup of speakers, this is an event you'll want to attend if you're in the Carolinas or surrounding areas. [Click here](http://info.vmware.com/content/VMUG_Conference_Registration?ug=ch) to register to attend!
