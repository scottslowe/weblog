title: 'Full Stack Journey Episode #1: Bart Smith'
url: /2016/01/08/full-stack-journey-ep001/
---

In this first-ever episode of the Full Stack Journey podcast, I talk with Bart Smith ([old GitHub account][link-1] migrating to [new GitHub account][link-2], [YouTube channel][link-3]). Bart shares some details about his journey from being a Microsoft-centric infrastructure engineer to what he calls a cloud-native full-stack engineer. Here are some notes from our conversation, along with some additional resources Bart wanted to share with readers/listeners. Enjoy!

The podcast audio recording is [available on Soundcloud][link-32].

## Show Notes

* His journey started in June 2014 as a result of the Microsoft announcement regarding support for Linux and Kubernetes on Azure---this really indicated a shift in the industry.
* Bart's view is that a full-stack engineer knows about operations, the hardware stack (compute, storage, network), the software (network, operating system [OS], management, logging), and most importantly knows how to "code" an immutable infrastructure. An operations full-stack engineer can read code, work with developers, and be part of a DevOps team of support DevOps teams in deploying code into production both to on-premises solutions and off-premises solutions.
* IT folks don't need to be strictly involved in software engineering to benefit from a journey toward a more full-stack role.
* His journey from Microsoft-centric engineer to cloud-native engineer encompasses learning the following areas:
    * Getting a good understanding of microservices (recommends book _Building Microservices_ by Sam Newman; [here's a link][link-5])
    * Container technologies ([Docker][link-15], most notably, but also [CoreOS][link-16] and [etcd][link-17]); recommends [this Docker course][link-4]
    * PaaS/container orchestration ([Mesos][link-18]/[Mesosphere][link-19], [OpenShift][link-20], Docker Swarm, [Kubernetes][link-21])
    * AWS (10x the size of all competitors), Joyent
    * [Microsoft][link-29] and/or [VMware][link-30], but _do not start here_ (start elsewhere)
    * [Otto][link-22] and [Terraform][link-23] by Hashicorp
    * [Ansible][link-26] (not Chef, Puppet, or Salt)
    * [Cassandra][link-24] and [Neo4j][link-25]
    * [Git][link-27]
    * VXLAN
* He highly recommends using OS X on Apple hardware (he bought a used MacBook Pro, including SSD, for less than 300 euros).
* Safari Books Online ([link][link-9]) a great resource, highly recommended.
* Bart believes attending meetups, if available in your area, is a valuable source of information.
* Attending relevant conferences, digging into the material, asking questions, and meeting people has also been very helpful.
* After attending a meetup or conference, be sure to give yourself a "call to action"---actually _do_ the thing about which you're learning.
* Bart recorded meetups so that he could review them later, multiple times if necessary---"repeat to remember, remember to repeat" has been a key learning strategy for him.
* Certifications may not be as valuable as they used to be (although Red Hat might be worthwhile); a lot of this learning is going to be something you're going to create/shape yourself.
* Sharing the information you've learned, or information you're creating as you learn, helps you and helps the community. [GitHub][link-28] is a great way to share.
* There should probably be more graphics and drawings!
* [DevOps Enterprise Summit][link-31] would be a good conference to attend (he couldn't make it this past year).
* Looking ahead, Bart is really intrigued by unikernels ([MirageOS][link-10] in particular).
