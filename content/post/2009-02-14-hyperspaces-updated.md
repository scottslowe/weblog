[Hyperspaces](http://www.hyperspacesapp.com/), the application designed to extend and build upon the built-in functionality of Spaces, has been updated again. My [first coverage][1] of Hyperspaces was back in October 2008, and at that time the application still had a few rough edges. I'm happy to report that Hyperspaces seems much more polished this time around---it's clear that Tony Arnold, the developer, has been paying attention to the details.

For example, the latest build of Hyperspaces provides an animation transition for desktop backgrounds, a feature that was lacking previously. In earlier builds, there was a jarring delay between switching desktops and the background switching as well; now, there is a nice transition from one background to the next. Much better!

Based on Tony's comments from [the first article][1] I know that he has a number of features still in the works. I'd like to cast my vote for a pager that isn't attached to the menu bar as the next major feature to be implemented. (I'd _really_ love to see desktop transitions, aka the "Cube effect," return, but something tells me that will be a lot harder than detaching the pager from the menu bar. I could be wrong, though.)

Either way, Tony, keep up the great work. Hyperspaces is looking good!
