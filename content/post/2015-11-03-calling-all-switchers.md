Are you a _switcher_? That is, are you someone who has transitioned from one IT discipline to an entirely new IT discipline? Perhaps you were a storage gal for a long time, and now you've successfully transitioned into a networking career. Maybe you used to be a Windows admin, and now Linux is your thing. Or perhaps you were a networking guy, and now you're coding like a madman. If this sounds like you, please read on!

If this describes you---or describes something you're in the middle of doing---I'd love to talk to you. Please hit me on Twitter (I'm [@scott_lowe][link-1]), or drop me an e-mail (use `first.last@firstlast.org`, substituting the correct values). I promise it won't take much of your time, and we can do this via whatever medium makes the most sense: e-mail, telephone, Skype, instant messaging, IRC...you let me know. I'm particularly interested in talking to folks to have made a really dramatic transition, not just moving from being a server administrator to being a virtualization administrator (let's face it, those two roles are fairly similar).

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

**UPDATE:** Thanks for everyone who took the time to contact me! I'm all set now, so no need for future folks to contact me (unless they just really want to!).
