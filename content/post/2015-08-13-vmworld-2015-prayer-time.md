title: VMworld 2015 Prayer Time

Last year, a group of believers gathered for a brief time of prayer while at VMworld 2014. This year, I'd like to again offer believers attending VMworld 2015 the same opportunity to gather together for a time of prayer before starting the day. If you're interested in attending, here are the details.

**What:** A brief time of prayer  

**Where:** Yerba Buena Gardens, behind Moscone North (by the waterfall)

**When:** Monday 8/31 through Wednesday 9/2 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before the keynotes start at 9am)  

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note that this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity. (I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities.)  

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the conference, and the attendees

Like last year, there's no need to RSVP or let me know that you'll be there, although you're welcome to do so if you'd like. There's also no need to bring anything except an open heart and a willingness to display your faith in front of others. This is a very casual gathering of believers---we'll gather together, share some prayer requests and needs, and then say a few words of prayer over each other and over the conference.

See you there!
