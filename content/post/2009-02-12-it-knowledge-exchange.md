I've blogged for [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/) a couple of times, and their blog, [Virtualization Pro](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/virtualization-pro/), is hosted on IT Knowledge Exchange. It wasn't until just recently that I noticed what [IT Knowledge Exchange (ITKE)](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/) was really all about.

In addition to hosting a number of blogs---both editorial, which is where you'll find Virtualization Pro, as well as by ITKE members---ITKE also hosts [IT Answers](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/itanswers/). Got a technical question? Here's the place to ask it. All sorts of people with all sorts of expertise are asking questions and answering questions here, which makes this a pretty good resource. If you're familiar with the [VMware Community Forums](http://communities.vmware.com/index.jspa), this is similar (but not constrained to a single vendor's products). If you're pressed for time, like I am, then ITKE's e-mail subscriptions and RSS feeds could be a big timesaver.

So, if you haven't checked out ITKE, it might be worth your time to go have a look.
