A new movie from the producers of "Facing the Giants" is set to open on September 26, 2008. The movie, "Fireproof", stars Kirk Cameron, and focuses on the story of a firefighter and his efforts to save a crumbling marriage. I absolutely love the tagline: "Never leave your partner behind."

The movie's web site is [here](http://fireproofthemovie.com/), and there's also a [Fireproof blog](http://fireproofthemovie.blogspot.com/) available as well.

Marriage resources based on the movie are available at [fireproofmymarriage.com](http://fireproofmymarriage.com/).

Lord willing, I will be there opening night, paying full price for tickets to see the movie. These kinds of movies are worth supporting.
