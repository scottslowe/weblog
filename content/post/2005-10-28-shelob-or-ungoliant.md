[This story](http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,105623,00.html) about the University of Indianapolis and their home-grown system for quarantining PCs infected by spyware or viruses is really interesting. Named [Shelob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelob) (and soon to be renamed [Ungoliant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungoliant) to prevent a conflict with another open source project), this system **_really_** works. Today. How is it, then, that a group of IT staffers at a university can come up with a system for network access control, but multi-million dollar companies like [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/) and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) can't? I could say that this is a testament to the value of open source software, upon which the solution is built, but that seems fairly obvious.
