As many of you probably already know, my wife Crystal ([@crystal_lowe](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter) runs something called Spousetivities, which organizes activities for spouses traveling to conference cities with conference attendees. (You can learn more about Spousetivities by visiting [the About page](http://spousetivities.com/about/).) In the past, Spousetivities was limited to VMworld. This past year, it expanded to include EMC World as well. And now it's expanding again to include [HP Discover Vienna](https://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2010/events/discover/vienna/index.php)!

As usual, Crystal and her team have organized some pretty awesome activities. These activities include:

* A trip to Viennese wine country

* A visit to the world-famous Vienna Christmas markets

* A trip to [Melk Abbey](http://www.stiftmelk.at/englisch/pages_melk/tourismusEN.html) (this event looks _very_ cool)

* Lunch on the River Danube

* A visit to [Schonbrunn Palace](http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/)

If you're headed to Vienna for HP Discover and bringing your spouse, or if you're a spouse going to Vienna with a conference attendee, I'd recommend taking a look at these activities. It's a great way to safely and easily see some of the great sights around this fantastic destination.

For more information on any of these activities, stroll over to the Spousetivities site and read [this detailed post](http://spousetivities.com/2011/11/dont-miss-spousetivities-at-hp-discover-vienna/).
