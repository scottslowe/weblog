[Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/) has finally caught up with [Novell NetWare](http://www.novell.com/netware/) in one key area, and that is in the enumeration of files and folders.  With [access-based enumeration](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=04A563D9-78D9-4342-A485-B030AC442084&displaylang=en), Windows Server 2003 now will display only those files and folders to which the user has permission. If no permission is given, the file or folder is not displayed. This is, in my opinion, a _major_ improvement in Windows' security.

I plan to give this functionality a swing on my own servers within the next few days. I'll post additional details here after my tests.
