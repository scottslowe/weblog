At [VMworld 2017][link-1] in Las Vegas, I'm organizing---as I have in previous years---a gathering of Christians for a brief time of prayer while at the conference. If you're interested in joining us, here are the details.<!--more-->

**What:** A brief time of prayer

**Where:** Mandalay Bay Convention Center, level 1 (same level as the food court), at the bottom of the escalators heading upstairs (over near the business center)

**When:** Monday 8/28 through Thursday 8/31 at 7:45am (this should give everyone enough time to grab breakfast before the keynotes start at 9am)

**Who:** All courteous attendees are welcome, but please note that this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centric activity (I encourage believers of other faiths/religions to organize equivalent activities)

**Why:** To spend a few minutes in prayer over the day, the conference, the attendees, and each other

You don't need to RSVP or anything like that, although you're welcome to if you'd like (just [hit me up on Twitter][link-2]). There's also no need to bring anything other than an open heart, your faith, and your willingness to display that faith in front of others. This is quite casual---we'll gather together, share a few prayer requests and needs, and then give folks the opportunity to pray as they feel led. If you don't like praying out loud in public, that's cool; we're not going to force anyone. We just want to give believers the opportunity to strengthen one another in the faith.

I hope to see you there!
