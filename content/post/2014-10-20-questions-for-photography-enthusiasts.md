It's no secret that I'm something of a photography enthusiast. To me, photography is a relaxing puzzle of how to assemble all the various pieces---setting, lighting, exposure, composition, etc.---to create just the right image. I'm not an expert, but that's OK; I just do this for fun and to relax. If you'd like to see a small sampling of some of the photos I've taken, I publish some of them [here on 500px.com](https://500px.com/slowe).

I know that a fair number of folks in the IT industry are also photo enthusiasts, and so I was curious to hear some feedback from fellow enthusiasts about their photography workflows. In particular, I'm curious to know about how others answer these questions:

* What formats do you use with your photos? (I've been shooting in RAW---NEF, specifically, since I'm a Nikon guy---then converting to Adobe DNG for use with Lightroom.)

* How do you handle long-term storage of your photos? (Once I have the photos in DNG in Lightroom, then I've been archiving the RAW files on my Synology NAS.)

* What pictures do you keep---all of them, or only the best ones? (So far, I've been keeping all the RAW files, archiving when necessary, but pruning down the DNGs stored in Lightroom.)

* How do you keep your files organized on disk? (I've been organizing mine by date, since this works well with the date-based filenaming convention I use.)

I think I've (finally) settled into a reasonable routine/approach, but it's always good to hear how others are doing it. You never know when you might learn something new! If you're a photo enthusiast like me---or even if you consider yourself something more, like a professional photographer---I'd be curious to know more about your workflow. Feel free to speak up in the comments below. All courteous comments are welcome!
