Chethan Kumar of VMware dropped me an e-mail last night (as he did to several other bloggers, I think) asking me to help raise awareness of the new release of the performance troubleshooting white paper for VMware vSphere 4.1. You can download the white paper [here](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-14905).

Some of the new sections added to this document, based on Chethan's post to the VMware Communities site, include:

* Troubleshooting performance problems in resource pools (both on standalone hosts and DRS clusters)

* Additional troubleshooting steps around memory pressure (including hosts with compressed or swapped memory)

* High CPU ready time in hosts that are not CPU saturated

* Environments using snapshots

I've downloaded the document and placed it on my "documents to read" list (a list that never seems to get any shorter!), and if you're responsible for managing a VMware vSphere environment I'd recommend you download it and read it as well.

In addition, Chethan specifically asked for the community to provide feedback and topics you'd like to see in future updates to the document. You can leave those suggestions here as comments to this post, or you can go the VMware Communities site and leave your comments there. Either way, be sure to speak up about what you would find useful and helpful in future revisions of the performance troubleshooting document.
