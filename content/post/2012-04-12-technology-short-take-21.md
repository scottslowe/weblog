It's been a while since I published my last Technology Short Take (found [here][1]), and in browsing my list of saved links I find that I don't really have that many to share. Which then leads to me to ask the question, "Why?" I think it's because I've been sharing lots of stuff via [my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe).

In any event, here are some older links that I've been saving up to share with you. Many of these posts are a bit older, but I'm including them here just in case someone missed them earlier. As usual, I hope that you find something useful here!

## Networking

* Derick Winkworth describes data center networking as "a messy pile of discombobulated garbage" in his post on [the sad state of data center networking](http://packetpushers.net/the-sad-state-of-data-center-networking/). As someone simply observing developments in data center networking from the outside while desperately trying to keep up, now I don't feel so bad that I don't necessarily get all of it.

## Security

* Pardon me for the self-promotion, but in order to prevent the ranks of the 600K Macs infected with Flashback from growing, I'd recommend you have a look at this list of [8 things to help secure your Mac][2]. Also, for more details on the latest Flashback variant, see [here](http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/trojan-downloader_osx_flashback_k.shtml).

* Interesting information on a potential VMware security vulnerability is available [here](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/522141). vSphere 5 is not affected.

## Storage

* I posted this article on Twitter, but wanted to share it here as well. This post by Richard Elling [on IOPS and latency](http://blog.richardelling.com/2012/03/iops-and-latency-are-not-related-hdd.html) is, in my opinion, a must-read.

## Virtualization

* I've really enjoyed several of Frank Denneman's SDRS-related articles. His article on [SDRS initial placement and datastore cluster defragmentation](http://frankdenneman.nl/2012/01/storage-drs-initial-placement-and-datastore-cluster-defragmentation/) was really good and in-depth (as are most, if not all, of his articles). Also good was the article on [anti-affinity rules and HA interoperability](http://frankdenneman.nl/2012/02/sdrs-anti-affinity-rule-types-and-ha-interoperability/) and the post on [SDRS load balancing with array-based auto-tiering](http://frankdenneman.nl/2012/02/storage-drs-io-load-balancing-and-array-based-auto-tiering/). Good stuff---thanks Frank.

* Speaking of array-based auto-tiering, Michael Webster clears up any potential confusion about [support for using Storage I/O Control with EMC FAST](http://longwhiteclouds.com/2012/03/15/storage-io-control-with-emc-fast-auto-tiering-is-supported/).

* A couple of Michael Webster's other posts also made it into my list of "things to mention": this post on [jumbo frames on vSphere 5](http://longwhiteclouds.com/2012/02/20/jumbo-frames-on-vsphere-5/) (with [more results](http://longwhiteclouds.com/2012/03/29/jumbo-frames-on-vsphere-5-update-1/) from vSphere 5 Update 1) and this post on [CA SSL certificates and vCenter 5](http://longwhiteclouds.com/2012/02/07/the-trouble-with-ca-ssl-certificates-and-vcenter-5/).

* Dave Hill has a great series on vCloud Director going on. Check out the different parts of this series ([part 1](http://www.virtual-blog.com/2012/02/vmware-vcloud-director-101-overview-part-1/), [part 2](http://www.virtual-blog.com/2012/03/vmware-vcloud-director-101-concepts-part-2/), [part 3](http://www.virtual-blog.com/2012/03/vmware-vcloud-director-101-concepts-allocation-models-part-3/), and [part 4](http://www.virtual-blog.com/2012/03/vmware-vcloud-director-101-networking-part-4/) on his site.
