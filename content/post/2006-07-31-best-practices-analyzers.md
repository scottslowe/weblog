The Exchange Best Practices Analyzer (ExBPA) has been around for a while now, and is a very useful tool in making sure that your Exchange implementation is following recommended best practices from Microsoft for optimal performance, reliability, and scalability. The ExBPA was recently updated to include the ability to check the overall Exchange topology for readiness to upgrade to Exchange Server 2007. The Exchange team blog has [full details on the new "Readiness Check"](http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2006/07/28/428506.aspx) in this posting.

In addition, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) has released the Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server Best Practices Analyzer (IsaBPA), which is designed to do the same thing for ISA implementations. Supporting both ISA 2004 and ISA 2006, IsaBPA helps make sure that the ISA deployment adheres to a set of best practices outlined by Microsoft, and identifies critical configuration errors or potential problems. The [IsaBPA can be downloaded](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d22ec2b9-4cd3-4bb6-91ec-0829e5f84063&DisplayLang=en) from the Microsoft Download Center.
