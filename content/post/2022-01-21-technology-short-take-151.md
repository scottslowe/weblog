Welcome to Technology Short Take #151, the first Technology Short Take of 2022. I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that 2022 is off to a wonderful start! I have a few more links than normal this time around, although I didn't find articles in a couple categories. Don't worry---I'll keep my eyes peeled and my RSS reader ready to pull in new articles in those categories for next time. And now for the content!<!--more-->

## Networking

* Mike Fiedler [explores differences][link-6] in ways for container-to-container communication to occur.
* Aidan Steele examines how [VPC sharing could potentially improve security and reduce cost][link-13].
* What do _you_ think [microsegmentation means][link-15]?
* Nick Schmidt talks about [using GitOps with the NSX Advanced Load Balancer][link-28].

## Servers/Hardware

* The Next Platform takes [a look at Amazon's Graviton3 processor][link-3].
* Ru Singh provides [a review][link-4] of her M1-based MacBook Air.
* Here's [a great review of the Framework laptop][link-11].
* Losing to Apple---whose M-series chips are widely regarded as faster and more efficient than Intel's chips---has apparently stung the chip giant into revving up the innovation engine. [These details on their 12th-generation H processors][link-12] shows that Intel appears to be intent to regain the lead. Time will tell how successful they are.
* Chris Evans revisits the discussion regarding [Arm processor architectures in the public cloud][link-22].
* And, speaking of Arm processor architectures in the public cloud, [here's another look][link-23] at Amazon's Graviton2 and Graviton3 chips, as discussed in a pair of re:Invent talks.

## Security

* Kat Traxler [considers the impact of the Log4J vulnerability in cloud-based environments][link-7].
* I was very glad to see [this blog post][link-10] about the financial future of the GnuPG project.
* The story of a developer deliberately polluting their open source projects---as outlined [here][link-19] for the "colors.js" and "faker.js" libraries hosted on NPM---is a software supply chain issue that I suspect many organizations hadn't considered. Now they're going to have to start accounting for this possibility.
* [Cross-platform malware][link-30]. Ugh.
* Orca Security [discusses the "Superglue" vulnerability][link-32] in AWS Glue.

## Cloud Computing/Cloud Management

* Benoît Bouré explains [how to use short-lived credentials to access AWS resources from GitHub Actions][link-14].
* Ivan Velichko has a detailed article on [Kubernetes API resources, kinds, and objects][link-17].
* Sander Rodenhuis wrote an article on [security policies in Kubernetes][link-18]. The post focuses on Otomi, which in turn leverages Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper.
* Michael Gasch pontificates on Knative's missteps in [this post from June 2021][link-20].
* Yann Léger and Alisdair Broshar [talk about the technology stack behind the Koyeb Serverless Engine][link-21].
* Lydia Leong has a great idea: why not [improve cloud resilience using things that actually work][link-25], instead of chasing [the multi-cloud failover unicorn][link-26]? There's some useful and practical advice here, in my opinion.
* Via the Kubernetes blog, Rory McCune of Aqua Security provides [some guidelines for securing admission controllers][link-31].

## Operating Systems/Applications

* I recently had a need to do a multicast DNS lookup, and [this article][link-1] was critical in figuring out how to use `dig` to do it.
* If you need a quick start for HashiCorp Vault, [this one][link-2] worked really well for me. I found it easier/better than the documentation on the HashiCorp web site, in fact.
* Dennis Felsing shares some thoughts on [switching to macOS after 15 years on Linux][link-5].
* Running Docker on an M1 Max-based system? [This article][link-8] may provide some useful information.
* [Here's some information][link-9] on why Microsoft Exchange stopped delivering e-mail messages on January 1, 2022.
* Mark Brookfield has started a series on automating SSL certificate issuance and renewal using HashiCorp Vault Agent, [here's part 1][link-16].
* Julia Evans has a quick post on [finding a domain's authoritative name servers][link-24]. I was already familiar with this process, but I appreciate that there are lots of folks out there who may not have had to ever do this.
* Here's [a handy list of secret phone codes you can use][link-27]. Some of these I already knew, but a few of them were new to me. Neat.
* The founder of the Nginx project recently stepped away from the project. Read more [here][link-29].
* [BIOS updates without a reboot][link-33], and under Linux first? Yes please!

That's all for now. I hope this was useful in some way! If you have any feedback for me---constructive criticism, praise, suggestions for where I can find more articles (especially if the site supports RSS!), feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! You can reach [me on Twitter][link-99], or hit me up in any one of a number of different Slack communities.
