If you live (or will be) in Denver next week---specifically, on Wednesday, November 1---I'll be joining the Denver Network Programmability User Group (NPUG) to talk about network programmability and [my recent book with Jason Edelman and Matt Oswalt][link-2] around network programmability and automation. We'd love to have you join us!<!--more-->

Here are the meeting details:

_When:_ Wednesday, November 1, at 4:00 Mountain Time  
_Where:_ GTRI, 990 S Broadway, Suite 300, Denver CO (free parking in and around GTRI)  
_What:_ Me joining the NPUG to share some thoughts on network programmability  
_Why:_ Because there will be food and drinks, and because you love talking about network programmability and automation  
_Who:_ You!

As I mentioned, there will be food and beverages provided for attendees so please [take a few moments to RSVP][link-1] (so that we can plan on how much food and drink to provide).

I'd love to see you there!
