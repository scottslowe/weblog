Long-time readers know that my wife, Crystal, has been running this thing called [Spousetivities][link-2] for a few (OK, eight) years now. While Spousetivities originally started out as a VMworld thing, it rapidly expanded, and this year Spousetivities will be at a number of events. That includes [the spring OpenStack Summit in Austin, TX][link-3]!

If you're planning to attend the Summit in Austin, why not bring your spouse/fiancé/partner/significant other with you? I can tell you from personal experience that having him or her there with you makes the conference experience more pleasant. In this particular case, Austin is a great place to visit in April and it is very affordable. Besides, Spousetivities has a great set of activities planned to keep your traveling companion(s) entertained while you're at the conference.

Here's a quick look at some of what's planned for that week:

* Explore Austin via a unique scavenger hunt experience, complete with prizes
* Cruise the lake on private, luxury paddle-wheel boat while enjoying a delicious catered lunch
* BBQ galore---after all, this is the BBQ capital and Spousetivities will make sure you get to try the famous BBQ of the Salt Lick
* Quaint and relaxing tour of historic Fredericksburg

On the Spousetivities site, Crystal has [more details on the activities][link-1]. You can sign up for any (or all!) of the activities [via the registration page][link-4]. If you haven’t registered already, go register for the OpenStack Summit now and sign your significant other, spouse, family, or friends traveling with you for Spousetivities. They are sure to have a great time, and you are sure to gain a wealth of information from the Summit.

I'll be at the Summit, so I hope to see you in Austin!
