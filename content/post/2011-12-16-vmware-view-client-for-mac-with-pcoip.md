title: VMware View Client for Mac with PCoIP

VMware just released the PCoIP-enabled version of the VMware View client for Mac OS X ([download here](http://www.vmware.com/go/macviewclient); login required). After having used it this morning to connect to my corporate View desktop, I must say that I am quite impressed.

The responsiveness of my View desktop is significantly improved over RDP. Under RDP, browsing any sort of Web site---and accessing various internal-only sites is a key use for my corporate View desktop---was just downright painful. With the new PCoIP-enabled Mac client, it's drastically better. Pages redraw much more quickly, and the browser is much more responsive.

Aside from the much-improved performance granted by the PCoIP support, a few other things stand out:

* It's nice to see VMware fully embrace the idea of developing for the Mac---no installer package, just open the DMG and drag-and-drop the application into your Applications folder. The new client also offers Lion full-screen support as well.

* The new client no longer requires the Microsoft RDP Client installed. (However, note that if you need RDP connectivity to Windows 7, the new client won't support that just yet. For that, you'll need to use the previous generation VMware View client along with the Microsoft RDP Client.)

* You can easily resize your desktop by simply resizing the window. That's a little thing, I know, but it's still handy.

Overall, it's great to see VMware working hard to expand endpoint availability. If I understand correctly, VMware also released updated clients for the iPad and Android as well, both of which also support PCoIP (the View client already supported PCoIP and I've used that before as well). Now we just need a PCoIP-enabled client for Linux and we're good to go!
