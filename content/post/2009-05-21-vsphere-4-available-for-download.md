As of today, May 21, 2009, the final GA builds of VMware vSphere 4--including VMware ESX 4 (build 164009), VMware ESXi 4 (build 164009), vCenter Server 4 (build 162902), VMware Consolidated Backup, VMware vCenter Data Recovery, and VMware vShield Zones are available for download from [VMware's web site](http://www.vmware.com/download/).

This is an event that the VMware community has been waiting to occur for quite some time now, and it's exciting to have the day finally here and the final code available to the general public.

Of course, I'm covering all these technologies in my upcoming _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ book, available for [pre-order](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470481382/ref=sr_1_1/189-8256881-3335259?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242907242&sr=1-1) now on Amazon and shipping in September. (By the way, I'm hearing rumors from my publisher that copies of the book may be available at VMworld 2009, but I'm not 100% sure yet. Stay tuned.)
