In case you hadn't heard, [Spousetivities](http://spousetivities.com/)--the spouse activities that had their genesis at VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas---has expanded once again! Last year, Spousetivities expanded to include EMC World, and just last week Crystal concluded her second year of activities at EMC World 2012 in Las Vegas. This year, Spousetivities expands to not only include VMworld and EMC World, but also [Dell Storage Forum 2012](http://www.dellstorageforum.com/), located this year in Boston, MA.

This is a great opportunity for Dell Storage Forum conference attendees to bring along their families to Boston and have confidence that their families will be well cared for and offered a great set of activities. Here's a quick peek at what Spousetivities has planned for Dell Storage Forum:

* A whale watching tour (get to know Zeppelin, Regulus, Ember, Eden, Tear, and the other whales!)

* Private trolley and walking tour of MIT

* A sight-seeing trolley tour

* Trolley and walking wine tour

* Boston Freedom Trail sight-seeing tour

* Private lunch cruise on a paddle wheel boat

* Private trolley and walking tour of Harvard

If you ask me, that's a pretty impressive line-up of activities. Dell Storage Forum 2012 starts in only a couple of weeks, so hurry and visit [the registration page](http://spousetivities-dsf2012.eventbrite.com/) to sign up for your activities. Also, help spread the word to anyone you might know who is also attending Dell Storage Forum. Given that Crystal and Spousetivities is new to the Dell community, I know that she could use all the help she can to get the word out about Spousetivities at Dell Storage Forum this year.

If you're headed to Boston for Dell Storage Forum and considering taking your family/spouse/partner with you, you definitely need to take a look at [the list of activities](http://spousetivities-dsf2012.eventbrite.com/). Your family/spouse/partner is worth it!
