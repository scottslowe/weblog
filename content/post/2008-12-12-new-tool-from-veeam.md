I'm sure I'm not the only one who received this e-mail:

>If your readers are among the 50,000+ people who have downloaded Veeam's popular freeware, FastSCP, they'll be interested to hear that Veeam is about to make available another great free tool. Just in time for the holidays, VMware pros can visit [http://www.veeam.com/xmas/default.html](http://www.veeam.com/xmas/default.html) and register to be among the first to receive Veeam's newest free tool to help manage VMware.

>We'll be unveiling what the new free tool is on Dec. 22 everyone who registers will automatically receive a download link that day via e-mail. This holiday gift is marked "do not open until Dec. 22."

I've already registered for my free copy. Any guesses as to what this new, free tool will be?
