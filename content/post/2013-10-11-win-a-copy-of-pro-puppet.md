Want to win a free copy of a book on Puppet? I recently came into possession of a second copy of _Pro Puppet_, a good book for those looking to get a bit deeper into declarative configuration management with Puppet. Since I can't use two copies, I'm giving one of them away to a lucky winner.

Here's how to enter:

1. Leave a comment here on this site. Be sure to use a valid e-mail address, because that's what I'll use to contact you.

2. In your comment, you **must** include a specific example of how you'd like to use Puppet in your environment to solve a configuration management problem. For example: "I'd like to learn to use Puppet to manage the configuration of my Apache web servers." Any comments that don't include a specific example of how you'd use Puppet won't be considered in the final drawing.

Since the shipping for the book is coming out of my own pocket, I'll have to limit this to US-based readers only (sorry international readers!). The shipping costs outside the US are simply too prohibitive.

Good luck!

**UPDATE:** The contest has been closed and the winner has been notified. Thanks to everyone who entered!
