I just wanted to let everyone know I'm taking a blogging hiatus for a while. I don't know yet how long. I do know that things are busy at work, I have a VMworld session to prepare, there are books to work on, and I have a family to enjoy while there is still time.

After five years of creating content for the site, it has become part of me. As such, I'm sure that I will pick up writing here again soon. For now, though, I'm going to take a break.

I do appreciate everyone who has read and responded to my work anytime over the last five years. I'm glad that I was able to help in some small way.

God bless!
