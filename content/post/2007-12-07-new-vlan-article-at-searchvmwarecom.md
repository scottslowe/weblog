[SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/) has published another article of mine, this one on the various VLAN configurations within VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3), the differences between each of them, and when each configuration may be appropriate.

Here's the obligatory teaser excerpt from the article:

>When VMware gurus talk about the use of virtual LANs (VLANs) with VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3), they are usually referring to the use of VLAN trunks. There are, however, three other types of VLAN configurations VI3 uses: virtual switch tagging (VST), external switch tagging (EST) and virtual guest tagging (VGT).  
>
>This tip is your guide to VST, EST and VGT, covering what they are and when to use them.

Read the [full article](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1283036,00.html) here.

Between this latest VLAN article, an [earlier VLAN article](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1280449,00.html) published on SearchVMware.com, a [VLAN article published here][1] on my site, and the latest [discussion of the use of the native VLAN][2], I'm trying to make sure everyone has the information they need to understand and use VLANs in their VI3 implementation. If there are other networking-related articles you'd like to see, please shoot me an e-mail and let me know, or post your ideas/suggestions in the comments below. Thanks!
