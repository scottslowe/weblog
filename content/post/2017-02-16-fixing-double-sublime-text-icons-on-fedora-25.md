title: Fixing Double Sublime Text Icons on Fedora 25
url: /2017/02/16/fixing-double-sublime-text-icons-on-fedora-25/
---

In [my previous post][xref-1] on how to install [Sublime Text 3][link-1] (ST3) on [Fedora 25][link-2], I mentioned that I have observed instances where launching ST3 via the `subl` command creates an additional icon in the Dash. While searching for a solution to an issue with LibreOffice icons, I found a fix for this problem.

The fix is to add this line to the `sublime-text.desktop` file (typically found in `/usr/share/applications`):

```text
StartupWMClass=subl
```

This tells Fedora and GNOME that when a window with the WMClass of "subl" appears, it should be considered a Sublime Text window. Once you add this line to the `sublime-text.desktop` file, then launching ST3 either via the GUI or via the `subl` command should create only a single ST3 icon in the Dash.

Now, back to trying to figure out this LibreOffice icon issue...
