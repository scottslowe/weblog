I suppose since I didn't post this until Wednesday, the title isn't exactly correct, is it?

In any event, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) has released the [security bulletin](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-jul.mspx) for July, which contains 3 critical updates (updates rated "critical" are considered the most severe by Microsoft). These updates patch security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, and Windows (including Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP SP2).

Microsoft had previously released a [workaround](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/903144.mspx) for the Internet Explorer flaw (note that this page now directs users to the location of the update rather than the earlier workaround).

Additional information on the patches can be found [here](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1836227,00.asp).
