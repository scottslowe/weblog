One of the RSS feeds from [Mac OS X Hints](http://www.macosxhints.com) today pointed me to a website on [DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)](http://www.dns-sd.org/). DNS-SD is part of the magic behind [Bonjour](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/) (formerly named Rendezvous), the way in which [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx) is able to automatically locate services across the network. Bonjour is used, for example, in locating an [Airport Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/) base station, or used by [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) to find web servers on your network. Personally, I like Bonjour, and it's good to see that it is finally being extended beyond single-segment implementations. And, with [Bonjour for Windows](http://a1408.g.akamai.net/7/1408/9955/20050505/akamai.info.apple.com/Bonjour/061-1768.20050505.BJWdw/BonjourSetup.exe) available from [Apple](http://www.apple.com), it's starting to look like a viable cross-platform solution for finding and connecting to network services automatically.
