It's a bit later than I would have liked (sorry [Jason](http://www.boche.net/blog/)!), but I wanted to write up a brief post-mortem on the VCDX Design Exam, which I took---and passed with a score of 408--this past Tuesday.

The exam wasn't particularly difficult in the sense of needing to know specific details. For example, I saw very few questions asking about a specific command-line parameter, the output of a specific command, or how many _X_ that feature _Y_ supports. There were a few, but not many. That doesn't mean you don't need to know that sort of stuff, because you do---but in a very different way.

The exam is moderately difficult in the sense that you are required to take the product knowledge you have and put it together to solve a scenario. The real kicker, in my mind, is the "Select the _best_ answer" prompt---implying that there was more than one technically correct answer. But which answer was best? Yes, you could do it via method A, but is method B better? Which method best satisfies the requirements described in the question? In this aspect, I did find the test challenging. Not incredibly difficult, but challenging.

Unfortunately, the test suffered from a few issues. There were several questions that had missing components necessary for a correct answer. I commented on those, but what else can you do? The design portion of the exam---by now you probably know there is a multiple choice section and a graphical design section---had a terrible interface. I struggled more with the interface than I did the question. Looking at it from VMware's perspective, I'm sure that it was incredibly difficult to come up with something like that, and I give them credit for actually trying (and not totally failing).

All in all, I think that VMware did a reasonably good job with the exam. It was very different from the Enterprise Admin exam but equally challenging in a very different way.

Now comes the real question: what did I use to study? Here's the resources that I used:

* The VI3 connections and ports diagram, downloaded [here from Forbes' site](http://www.vreference.com/2009/09/22/firewall-diagram-updated-to-version-3/)

* _iSCSI Design Considerations and Deployment Guide_ from VMware

* _Configuring and Troubleshooting N\_Port ID Virtualization_ document from VMware

* _Setup for Microsoft Cluster Service_ document from VMware

* _Fibre Channel SAN Configuration Guide_ from VMware

* _Virtual Machine Backup Guide_ from VMware

* _Resource Management Guide_ from VMware

* Duncan's [VMware HA deepdive](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/vmware-high-availability-deepdiv/)

* VI3 security hardening white paper from VMware

I used all this in conjunction with the Design Exam blueprint, of course.

So, there you go: there's my brief analysis of my VCDX Design Exam experience. Your mileage may vary, of course, since there are numerous versions of the exam.
