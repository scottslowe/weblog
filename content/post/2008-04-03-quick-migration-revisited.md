Earlier today I participated in a webinar with VMware in which the subject of Microsoft's Quick Migration functionality came up. I've discussed [Quick Migration vs. live migration][1] (VMotion in the VMware world) before, but this time I had the opportunity to see an interesting video demo of Quick Migration.

The video demo of Quick Migration is [available here](http://blip.tv/file/793841/).

Now, I'll grant you that this video was produced by VMware and will quite naturally be slanted against Microsoft in favor of VMware. With that in mind, let me ask this question: **Could the problems shown in the demo be eliminated with a correct setup?**

Microsoft experts and experienced Hyper-V testers/users, I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments below. We all know that it's possible to create a demo environment that doesn't follow vendor best practices and therefore puts that vendor in a bad light; was this the case here? Or are these problems with Quick Migration accurate?
