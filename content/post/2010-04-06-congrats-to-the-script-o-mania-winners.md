Just last week VMware wrapped up its Script-O-Mania contest; the winners of the contest are announced [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/developer/2010/03/script0mania-contest-winners.html). I had the privilege---and the responsibility---of being a judge for the contest. It wasn't an easy task; all the entries submitted were very good, and it was difficult picking only three to be the winners.

In the end, the three judges (myself and two developers at VMware) selected the following three scripts as winners:

1. The first place winner was Alan Renouf with [Who Created That VM?](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-12193). We felt that this script really answered a need that end users have in tracking VMs.

2. In second place was William Lam with [vAppManagement.pl](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-11690). The judges liked the completeness of this script, its functionality, and the fact that it focused on vApps---a key part of VMware's cloud-centric functionality moving forward. As with Alan's script, we felt that it really filled a gap in what end users needed.

3. In third place was Arnim Van Lieshout with [Get-VMDiskMapping](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-12180). As with the other winning scripts, the judges felt that this was useful and added functionality for end users.

Not to be excluded, the honorable mentions---Arnim's [import/export script](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-12182) and Luc Dekens' [PSTop](http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-12191) and [Report PCI Hardware](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/258489) scripts---were also rated highly by the judges.

As I mentioned earlier, it was a difficult process to select the winners. There were some scripts that I favored that didn't make the final cut; likewise, there were some scripts that the other judges favored but didn't make the final selection. Having been in this sort of position as a "Best of VMworld" judge with TechTarget (a role I will likely have to forgo this year now that I work for a vendor), I've been through this process before. In the end, we were able to settle on a core group of scripts that we felt satisfied the criteria and were valuable to the community.

Regarding the criteria, it has been asked about the ESXi-specific nature (or lack thereof) of some of the scripts. All of the winning scripts are fully functional with ESXi. We did not exclude a script or an entry because it also worked with vCenter Server or VMware ESX; we defined an "ESXi script" as a script that did not require the COS in order to be functional. All these scripts met that definition.

All in all, it was a fun (yet challenging) experience to be a judge on this contest. I hope that I'll have the opportunity to do so again in the future!
