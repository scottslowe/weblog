title: Canceling the OVS Cookbook Project

---

In my list of [proposed 2017 projects][xref-1], I mentioned that I wanted to launch an open source book project. In late February, I [launched][xref-2] _The Open vSwitch Cookbook_, an unofficial---as in not formally affiliated with the Open vSwitch (OVS) project---effort to gather together OVS "recipes" into an open source book. Today, I'm shutting down that project, and here's why.

It really comes down to wanting to be a better member of the OVS community. I honestly hadn't anticipated that the OVS community might prefer that the information I was going to gather in these "recipes" be collected in [the OVS documentation][link-1] (which has undergone a tremendous transformation). Instead of creating yet another source of information for OVS, I'll focus my efforts on expanding the upstream documentation. This will take some effort on my part---I'll need to learn [reStructuredText][link-2] and spend some time understanding how the docs are organized now---but I think that it's the better long-term option for the OVS community as a whole.

And what about my goal for launching an open source book project? I'll continue to evaluate options on that front to see if it makes sense, and I'll post here if and when something happens.
