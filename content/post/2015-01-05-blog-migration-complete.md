title: Blog Migration Complete

The blog migration is finally complete! It's taken quite a while, but I've finally managed to migrate the over 1,600 posts from my original WordPress installation over to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages. I'll have another post later that goes into more detail on the process that I followed (and why) as well as some of the tools that I used in the migration.

As of right now, there are 2 outstanding issues:

1. While all the content is here, what's **not** here is the comments (yet). I'm still working through some issues with Disqus, but I hope to have the issues resolved soon.

2. Also, depending on when you read this, my original domain ("blog.scottlowe.org") may or may not be working with the new content.

I appreciate your patience as I work through these issues.

I'd also appreciate it if you could let me know if you find anything that's not working, such as links to other blog posts, code listings, images, etc. Because this entire site is a GitHub repo, if you're so inclined you're welcome to clone the repo, fix the problems, and submit a pull request. If you don't feel like doing that, just drop me an e-mail. (My address is on the About page.)
