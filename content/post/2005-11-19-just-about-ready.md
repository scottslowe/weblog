This new blog is just about ready for public consumption. I just finished configuring the permalink structure so that all posts have a static URL, using a pretty common structure that includes the date of the post in the URL. (This seems to be a reasonably well-accepted practice.)

With the static URLs for permalinks also come static URLs for category archives and feeds. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll have to go back and rework any internal links I created in my own posts.

In addition, I reworked the template to include a hyperlink for adding a post's URL to your [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) bookmarks. Now you can add an entry to your bookmark list with ease!
