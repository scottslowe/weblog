title: Prayer Time at the Austin Summit

A large portion of the OpenStack community is gathered in Austin this week for [the Spring 2016 OpenStack Summit][link-1]. As I've done at previous Summits (and other events), I'm offering to gather with other Christian believers for a brief time of prayer in the mornings before the sessions kick off each day.

Normally I get these arranged much earlier, so I apologize for not getting this out there sooner. That being said, if you're a Christian and interested in gathering for a brief time of prayer, we will be meeting outside the Austin Convention Center at 8:30 am. We'll meet along East 4th Street, on the convention center side of the Downtown Station.

Anyone is welcome to join us, but please note that this will be a distinctly Christian-focused and Christ-centered event.

You don't need to RSVP or let me know you'll be there; just feel free to stop by. I hope to see you there!
