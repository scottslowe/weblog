Just yesterday, I was asking if Unity---the Coherence-killing feature that was soon to be added to VMware Fusion---was [real or rumor][1]. (Of course, yesterday I was also getting updated by the Fusion developers that this is indeed _not_ rumor and is [definitely real](http://compfusion.blogspot.com/2007/06/leapfrogged.html).) Now I'm here to tell you that I have experienced it with my own eyes.

VMware Fusion Beta 4 has been released (get it [here](http://www.vmware.com/mac/)), and with it comes Unity. In a word: Wow! It's pretty disconcerting to see Windows applications (like a command prompt, Internet Explorer, or Visio) running side-by-side with [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/), Mail.app, and [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/). Interleave windows? Not a problem. Drop shadows? There. Minimization effects? Yep. Aside from the window decorations, you would be hard-pressed to tell which applications were running natively in [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) or in virtualization.

And **that**, my friends, is the heart of what I described ages ago (OK, perhaps it only seems like ages ago) as [application agnosticism][2]. With virtualization technology and UI integration like this, who cares what OS an application is written for? Of course, we still have a ways to go to fully realize application agnosticism, since Unity is only available for Mac OS X (not Linux or Windows), but this is a powerful step in the right direction.

My hat is off to the Fusion developers. Well done! A lot of people were predicting that [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) had too much of a lead in Mac virtualization, but all of you have definitely proved them wrong. Keep up the good work!

&lt;aside&gt;Boring technical question to any VMware developers, Fusion team members, etc: Is Unity debuting on OS X because of some advantage within Mac OS X itself, or simply because of the timing and the competition? I _am_ a Mac fan, after all, and was curious if my favorite OS had a leg up on the competitors that made it easier to create Unity.&lt;/aside&gt;
