In the United States, today is Thanksgiving---a day to give thanks for the many things we have in our lives. I just wanted to take a moment today to give thanks for a few of the most important things in my life:

* My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ

* My beautiful and loving wife, Crystal

* My awesome kids (Summer, Johnny, Elizabeth, Michael, Rhys, Sean, and Cameron)

* My sons-in-law (Matt and Christopher)

* My exchange student, Tim

* My granddaughter, Lexi

* My health

* My career

If you celebrate Thanksgiving, I encourage you to take a moment and consider the important things in your life for which you should be thankful.

If you don't celebrate Thanksgiving, that's OK too---it might still be beneficial to reflect upon the good things in your life.

Happy Thanksgiving!
