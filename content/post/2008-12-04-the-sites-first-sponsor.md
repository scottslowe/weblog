After more than three years and thousands upon thousands of visitors, today I picked up the first sponsor for the site. [VMpeople](http://www.vmpeople.net/) has agreed to sponsor the site, so you'll see VMpeople graphics in the sidebar on the home page, category pages, and tag pages. I'd like to thank VMpeople for their sponsorship.

So, what does this mean for the future of the site? First, and perhaps foremost, it does _not_ mean a shift in the site to make money. My only real goal in seeking sponsorship was to cover hosting costs. Yes, I am open to discussing additional sponsorship opportunities (if anyone is interested), but these will be limited. Google ads---absent from the site for quite a while now---may make a (muted) return as well. In all cases, every effort will be made to keep the advertising unobtrusive. Unless hosting costs skyrocket, I have no plans to insert ads into the middle of posts; they will remain in the sidebar and/or the site footer.

I will not be adding ads or links to the RSS feed, but it is possible that I will drop back to a summary feed instead of full feeds. I haven't decided about that one just yet.

If you're interested in donating to help support the site, I'm certainly open to that as well. Drop me an e-mail and I'll give you the details.

Thanks again to all my readers! I appreciate everyone's support and help in making the site what it is. Feedback, suggestions for improvement, and constructive criticism is always welcome.
