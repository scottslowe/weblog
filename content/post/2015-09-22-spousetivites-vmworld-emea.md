[Spousetivities][link-2] returns to VMworld EMEA this year with a new set of activities. If you haven't [registered][link-1] yet, here's a quick look at the pretty impressive set of tours and activities that are planned.

* _Montserrat and Wine Country:_ The famous Monastery of Montserrat, one of the black Madonnas of Europe, Santa Cova, a fantastic lunch of local Catalan country cuisine, and wine tasting. What more could one want?
* _Costa Brava and Medieval Girona:_ It's not every day you get the opportunity to tour a medieval walled city founded by the Romans in the 1st century.
* _Wines of Catalunya:_ Personal tours with local, resident wine makers arranged exclusively for Spousetivities participants.
* _Medieval mountain village and panoramic trails:_ Cobblestone streets and stone houses in a medieval mountain village, then a four-course lunch in a traditional Catalan country restaurant followed by a light hike to some great look-outs, streams, rivers, and waterfalls.

For more detailed descriptions of the activities, I encourage you to visit [the Spousetivities site][link-3]. When you're ready to get signed up, head on over to [the registration page][link-1]. These are some pretty great activities!
