Can I ask a favor? In the spirit of transparency and honesty, I want to point out that this is a request for my own benefit, but it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes of your time. You see, a local EMC partner named eGroup (here's [their web site](http://www.egroup-us.com/)) is running this contest to win an iPad. The contest involves taking pictures of an "I love eGroup" sticker in various and interesting places. Since I recently traveled to Cork, Ireland, to support some of EMC's European partners, I took a few photos while I was in Ireland and I submitted them to the contest.

Now, you might be saying, "But Scott, I thought you already have an iPad?" You're right, I do. But I want to get one for Crystal, who could really use it with her online classes (she's working toward a degree in education). So, if I can win this iPad, then I'll have one for Crystal to use. (OK, so maybe it's not entirely for my own benefit after all!)

Here's what I need you to do:

1. Log into Facebook.

2. Go the [eGroup Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/eGroup-Technology-Solutions-for-Serious-Competitors/123766450990135) and "Like" the page.

3. Go to the eGroup Official Photo Contest Entries page ([here's the URL](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=12562&id=123766450990135)).

4. Vote for my photos by "Liking" the photos. I have two of them: one with me in the stocks at the Cork City Gaol (Jail), and another one of two wax figurines playing cards and one of the figures has an eGroup sticker as his "trump card". _You'll need to be sure to actually click on the photo and then "Like" the photo in order for the vote to count!_

That's all! See, I told you it would only take a couple of minutes. Besides, we all know you're probably going to log into Facebook sometime today anyway, so why not take a minute and help me out? Thanks!

**UPDATE:** It turns out you need to "Like" the [main eGroup Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/eGroup-Technology-Solutions-for-Serious-Competitors/123766450990135) as well. Be sure to click the photo that you want to vote for in order for the vote to count. I've updated the instructions, and thanks for your help!
