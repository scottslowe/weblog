As a follow-up to my posting [Zero-Day IE Exploit][xref-1], it has now been discovered that this exploit is no longer just a denial of service (DoS) flaw, but rather a flaw that can allow remote code execution (see [here][2] for more information). As of this writing, there is no patch for this vulnerability and the only workaround is to disable Active Scripting in IE.

For your convenience, here's a [link][3] to a Microsoft KB article that describes how to disable Active Scripting.

Alternately, you can just switch to [Firefox][4] (which, by the way, is supposed to release Firefox 1.5 sometime today).
