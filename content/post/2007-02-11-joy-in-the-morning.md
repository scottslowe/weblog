Have you ever been in a situation so dire, so serious, so---I'm not sure which word to use here---that you couldn't see your way out of it? Ever been in darkness so deep that you couldn't even see your hands in front of your face? (Side note here: if you've ever been on a tour of an underground cavern, you'll know what I'm talking about.) We've probably all been there, and according to the Bible this is only a temporary thing:

>For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. (Psalms 30:5, KJV)

Right now in my life, it is the middle of the night. Weeping abounds. I have lost someone near and dear to my heart, and I don't know what comes next. When will the morning come? When will the night end? How long will this last?

In my head, I can hear the Scriptures that talk about trial and tribulation.

>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. (James 1:2-3, KJV)

Patience? I didn't ask for patience. I don't want patience. I just want this to end.

>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28, KJV)

Work together for good? I don't think so. How can this be good? How can this be part of God's plan? I'd like to know _that_.
