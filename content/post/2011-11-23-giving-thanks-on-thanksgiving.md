Here in the United States we are preparing to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, and it's a time of reflection. It's a time to be thankful for what we have and what we've been given. This past year has been a tremendous year for me, both personally and professionally, with lots of things for which to be thankful:

* Along with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing, in March we launched _VMware vSphere Design_ (available [here from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Design-Forbes-Guthrie/dp/0470922028/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322086808&sr=8-1)). Even now---as far as I'm aware---it's the only book on the market to comprehensively address vSphere-related design considerations.

* In May, my oldest daughter gave birth to her first child, a girl.

* I relocated from Raleigh-Durham, NC to Denver, CO. I'm _very_ thankful for this relocation---my family and I are really enjoying the new area.

* In October, _Mastering VMware vSphere 5_, still one of the only vSphere 5 books on the market (and the only comprehensive look at the new virtualization suite from VMware), became widely available.

* In November, my 1998 Chevy Suburban (still with its original engine) rolled past 300,000 miles. Now **that's** something for which to be thankful!

While I can thank a number of people who have helped me this year---people like Forbes and Maish, for allowing me to join them on the Design book; my editor, Agatha; my co-workers at EMC on the vSpecialist team; my wife, Crystal, for her never-ending support and tireless cheerleading; Forbes, Gabe, and Glenn for their help with the last version of Mastering---my greatest thanks is reserved for the Lord. All my successes and all my triumphs come from Him.

So, in this Thanksgiving season, while I extend my thanks to my family, my friends, and my co-workers, I'd also like to extend my thanks to the Lord. Thanks for blessing me, thanks for providing for me, and---most importantly---thanks for saving me.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
