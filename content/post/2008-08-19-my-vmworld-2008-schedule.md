As you can see, there are some gaps in the schedule. First, I've specifically blocked off time to go to the vendor pavilion and talk to some vendors about their products. This is something that I always say I'll get around to doing, but never actually make it. This year I decided to fix that by scheduling time specifically for that. Second, I'm working with [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/) again this year on some stuff, so there's time set aside for that. Finally, my boss has scheduled some meetings with various people while I'm there, so I had to set aside time for that as well.

If you're interested in catching up with me this year, shoot me an e-mail and let me know. I'll do my best to meet with you while I'm there. In addition, I'm getting in early before the conference and not leaving until the Friday afternoon, so I might be able to meet with someone outside the conference days themselves.

If you're attending and have a session suggestion for me, feel free to shout out in the comments below. Thanks!
