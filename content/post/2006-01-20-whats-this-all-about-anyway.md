Is it just me, or is anyone else bothered by the recent stories of [MSN and Yahoo turning over customers' search terms](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1913105,00.asp) to the Federal government? Apparently, the same request was made to Google as well, and Google is [battling the request](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1912958,00.asp).

Supposedly, the data being requested by the government is intended to be used as evidence in a trial that could revive a child privacy law intended to protect children online. As a father myself, I know how important it is to safeguard our children while they are online, but I'm loath to let the government do it via legislation---the track record isn't really all that great. Remember CAN-SPAM, anyone?

In any case, perhaps I'm just paranoid, and some would claim that my resistance to this and other similar moves indicates a desire to hide something from the government. No, it's just that as a free society that desires to remain free we've got to draw the line somewhere. Why not here?
