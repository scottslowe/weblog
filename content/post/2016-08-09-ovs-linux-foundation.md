title: Open vSwitch Now a Linux Foundation Project

News emerged today that [Open vSwitch (OVS)][link-1] has formally moved over to the [Linux Foundation][link-2]. This is something that has been discussed within the OVS community for a while, and I for one am glad to see it happen.

Why am I glad to see it happen? The project can finally shed itself of the (unfair) claims that the governance under Nicira (and later VMware) wasn't "open enough." These accusations persisted despite numerous indications otherwise. Thomas Graf, an OVS committer---who does not work for VMware, for the record---came to this conclusion in [his OVSCon 2015 presentation][link-3]:

>OVS is one of the most effective and well governed open source projects I’ve worked on.

Moving to the Linux Foundation allows OVS to continue to grow and flourish without continued accusations of unfair governance. The project intends to continue to use its existing governance model, in which technical leadership of the project is determined by the committers, and committer status is determined by your involvement in the project via code contributions and code reviews.

For more information, refer to [the official Linux Foundation press release][link-4].
