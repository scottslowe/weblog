So a couple more articles I wrote have been published by SearchVMware.com:

**[Deduplication enhancements improve NetApp on VMware ESX](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1335560,00.html)**

>NetApp storage area network (SAN) deduplication is useful for reducing storage requirements and saving space out of the box. When combined with a VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3) or a virtual desktop environment, however, a few simple configurations can offer additional space savings and minimize the overhead of running deduplication on a storage array.

**[Physical network design options for VI3](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1334966,00.html)**

>VMware ESX offers outstanding support for a wide variety of networking configurations. Users have the option of using network interface card (NIC) teaming with or without physical switch support; numerous VLAN configurations, three of which are described in more detail in [VST, EST and VGT tagging tips](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1283036,00.html); support for both active and standby NICs, including per-port group active/standby NICs; and jumbo frame support. With all these options, it can be daunting to find the right configuration for your environment. In this article, we take a closer look at some network design decisions and how they play into the physical side of the network.

As usual, these articles have been added to my [Delicious.com bookmark list](http://delicious.com/slowe/) and tagged with "Articles"; you can view my full list of articles [here](http://delicious.com/slowe/Articles). (Oh, I added a video I shot while at VMworld 2008 to that list as well, in case you were wondering why it's there.)
