Let's get right to the point and set the record straight: I am not, nor have I ever been, affiliated with or employed by the FBI or any other government agency.

That's why I was surprised when word surfaced that I had been implicated in some sort of conspiracy regarding a plan to place secret backdoors into an OpenBSD cryptographic framework, and that my recent advocacy of OpenBSD was based on my alleged involvement with the FBI.

I don't know where the person who started this rumor got his information, but he is sadly mistaken regarding my involvement. Perhaps [the other Scott Lowe][1] is involved; I don't know. What I do know is this: I'm not affiliated with, supported by, employed by, associated with, or in support of the FBI in any way, shape, form, or fashion. **Quite simply, it wasn't me.**

Feel free to post any additional questions or courteous comments below. I'll answer all relevant questions openly and honestly.
