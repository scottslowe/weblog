The fine folks over at [Hyper9](http://www.hyper9.com/) recently offered me a very limited number of _special_ beta invitations for Hyper9's new Virtualization Mobile Manager (VMM) product. As you may already know, VMM is the brainchild of Andrew Kutz, who recently joined Hyper9 and has already released a few snippets of code via H9Labs.

Here are some highlights of VMM:

* Supports all major hypervisors: VMware Server 2, VMware Infrastructure 3 (VMware ESX and VMware ESXi 3.5, VirtualCenter 2.5), Microsoft Hyper-V, and Citrix XenServer 5

* Runs as an Apache Tomcat web application, supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X

* Accessible from just about any mobile device: Apple iPhone, Blackberry, Google Android-based phones, and Windows Mobile devices

* "Gracefully degrades" into Lite Mode if the mobile device doesn't support all the web UI features

While the VMM beta is open to the general public, I have 15 _special invitations_ that will grant additional benefits (extra perks, if you will). Specifically, these beta invitations will come with:

* A 50% discount on the already low pricing for VMM once it is released

* Automatic entry into a contest, starting in June, to win a mobile device

* A limited edition Hyper9 T-shirt (assuming you provide a little feedback to the team at Hyper9)

Interested in one of these special invitations? Well, you're going to have to work for it. Post a comment to this article telling me why you should be one of the lucky 15 readers who gets a special invitation. Telling me you'll help promote my [upcoming vSphere book][1] might improve your chances...or it might not! I'll leave comments open until Friday, May 22, or until I get 30 comments on the article, **whichever comes first**. From the comments on the article I'll select the top 15 to receive the special invitation to the VMM beta.

In the event you aren't interested in one of the special invitations, or if you read this article after the invitations have already been given out, you can also register for the beta from [the Hyper9 community site](http://community.hyper9.com/forums/t/257.aspx).

So post your comment now!
