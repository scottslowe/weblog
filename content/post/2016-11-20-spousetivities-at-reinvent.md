For the first time ever, Spousetivities will be at [AWS re:Invent][link-1] in Las Vegas! This means that IT pros traveling to Vegas can plan on bringing along their spouse, partner, significant other, or family member(s) and know that there are fun, safe, organized activities for them.

So what's planned? Here's a quick look:

* More cooking fun with Chef Phillip Dell, a previous season winner on Food Network's "Chopped" show
* Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon tour (a must-see if you haven't been before)
* Vegas food tour (hosted by Chef Dell, of course!)

As is a tradition with Spousetivities, participants in the activities have the chance to win prizes like iPads, Bose headphones, VR headsets, and lots of other goodies.

Crystal's [blog post on the Spousetivities site][link-2] has a few more details, and [registration is open right now][link-3].
