I like to think that I'm a fairly intelligent guy, able to pick up most things reasonably quickly given the opportunity. After all, I transitioned from a Windows-only SE into an SE with a good reputation for [VMware ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/esx/), various Linux flavors, [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), and some [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/) configuration (hey, if you can do [GRE tunnels with IPSec encryption][1], you're not too shabby with IOS). But I'm having a real problem with NFS.

I know, it seems silly, but I just can't wrap my head around how it works. In particular, the [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com/) implementation of NFS and the `/etc/exports` file that Data ONTAP uses seems to be very different than the way you would configure NFS on Linux or Solaris. Even when I go through the FilerView GUI to configure an NFS export, it doesn't seem to work the way I expect. To be fair, I'm sure this is just a lack of understanding on my part and not necessarily a flaw or drawback in the NetApp implementation.

Take this example. I recently added another old F840 storage system to my lab at the office, and will begin setting up a demo [SnapMirror](http://www.netapp.com/products/enterprise-software/data-protection-software/replication-software/snapmirror.html) environment to show to customers (SnapMirror with [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) on NetApp is going to be slick!). I thought I'd also start performing some NFS testing as well; I'm particularly interested in thin provisioning the VMDKs on a thin provisioned [FlexVol](http://www.netapp.com/products/enterprise-software/storage-system-software/provisioning-volume-management/flexvol.html) via NFS. So I create a new FlexVol and then proceed to configure a new NFS export. After walking through the NFS export wizard in FilerView and specifying my MacBook Pro's IP address as having both read/write access and root access, I mount the export and proceed to try to copy an ISO image file. Denied! Huh? Checking the properties, I see that I only have read-only permissions. What's up with that?

I try several other variations, and all of them provide the same result. How can that be? If my host's IP address is provided read/write access, why do I have read-only access? Is one option overriding another? How do the options interact with each other? I'm sure these are silly/easy questions for those well-versed in NFS, but for whatever reason I'm having a hard time here.

If anyone could share some enlightening information, I'd certainly appreciate it.
