This weekend I made a couple of small changes to the categories on the site, in an effort to make navigation a bit more intuitive. In the past, readers had expressed some confusion over the "Education" and "Explanation" categories, and---to be frank---their confusion was warranted. I also wasn't clear on the distinction between those categories, so this post explains the changes I've made.<!--more-->

The following category changes are now in effect on the site:

* First, the "Education" category has been _completely_ removed. I try to make almost everything on this site educational in nature, so why have an "Education" category? This really only affects you **if** you'd subscribed to that category's RSS feed. (Did you know that [every category and every tag has its own RSS feed][xref-1]?)
* A lot of the content from the "Education" category has been moved into [the "Explanation" category][link-1]. This is the category that will contain posts where I provide some level of explanation around a concept, technology, product, or project.
* [The "Tutorial" category][link-2] also picked up some new articles from the now-eliminated "Education" category. The "Tutorial" category contains walkthroughs or step-by-step instructions for doing something. There's most likely going to be explanation along the way, but the distinction between "Tutorial" and "Explanation" is that the latter won't contain step-by-step instructions for anything.
* I added [a new "Introduction" category][link-3], where I'll put introductory-type posts about some technology, product, or project. The amount of explanation provided will be less than a typical article in the "Explanation" category, where I'll tend to go a bit deeper.

I hope that these organizational changes make sense to readers, and make it easier to find the content you're seeking. If you have feedback---and all constructive feedback is more than welcome!---please feel free to contact [me on Twitter][link-4] or reach out to me on any one of a number of Slack communities. Thanks for reading!
