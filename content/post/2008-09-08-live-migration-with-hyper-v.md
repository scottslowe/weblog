I received an e-mail today from Microsoft about their "Get Virtual Now" launch event taking place in Bellevue. That was nothing surprising, but what did catch my eye was this little excerpt:

>Microsoft demonstrated for the first time a live migration feature of Windows Server 2008 R2.

This is the first time I've heard of live migration being demonstrated with Hyper-V and the first time I've seen the feature attached to an actual product release. Now if we could just get a timeframe on the release of Windows Server 2008 R2...

**UPDATE:** [This InfoWorld article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/09/08/Microsoft_to_give_away_upgraded_HyperV_software_1.html) seems to imply, mistakenly to my belief, that Hyper-V Server 2008 will include live migration. It's my understanding that Hyper-V Server 2008 is simply the Microsoft equivalent of ESXi---sporting a greatly stripped-down Windows Server 2008 parent partition and the Hyper-V hypervisor---and will **_not_** include live migration. The live migration functionality is slated to be included in Windows Server 2008 R2, due sometime in 2010. If anyone has any information to the contrary, please let me know.
