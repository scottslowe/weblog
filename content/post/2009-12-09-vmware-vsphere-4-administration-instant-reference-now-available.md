This afternoon UPS delivered to my door a box full of copies of my latest book, written in partnership with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson. _VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference_ is a hands-on how-to guide for vSphere administrators. The book will be especially helpful for newer administrators who are still learning their way around VMware vSphere and the vSphere Client, but I think even experienced administrators will still find some useful information tucked away here and there. Jase, Matthew, and I worked very hard on this book, and we hope that you find it useful.

Generally, the fact that I received my copies means that the book is in the warehouse and will start shipping very soon. You can [pre-order the book](http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Administration-Instant-Reference/dp/0470520728/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260399569&sr=8-3) right now on Amazon.com and it should start shipping very soon. Amazon hasn't yet updated the site to show an anticipated shipping date, but I would strongly imagine it will start shipping very soon. Go order a copy now for the VMware geek in your life and give it as a Christmas gift!
