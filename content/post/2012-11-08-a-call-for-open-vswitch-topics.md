I've been writing quite a bit about [Open vSwitch (OVS)](http://openvswitch.org), a technology project I think is fairly central to a number of very interesting initiatives. What I wanted to do with this post was pose a question to my readers: what other OVS-related topics would you like me to explore?

Here's a quick rundown of what I've written about OVS so far:

[Installing KVM and Open vSwitch on Ubuntu][1]  

[Some Insight into Open vSwitch Configuration][2]  

[Link Aggregation and LACP with Open vSwitch][3]  

[VLANs with Open vSwitch Fake Bridges][4]  

[Wrapping libvirt Virtual Networks Around Open vSwitch Fake Bridges][5]  

[Running Host Management on Open vSwitch][6]  

[Layer 3 Routing with Open vSwitch][7]  

[Using VLANs with OVS and libvirt][8]

There is still so much to cover, though. For example, here are some of the topics I'm still exploring (and planning to write about):

* Trunking VLANS to guest domains (this one is almost fully written)

* Using sFlow with OVS

* Using OpenFlow with OVS (probably using Floodlight)

* Controlling multiple OVS instances with a single OVS controller

* Network tunneling with OVS and GRE

My question to you, the readers, is this: what other topics should I be exploring that aren't listed? Are there topics in the list of planned posts that are of greater interest/value, and therefore should be prioritized? (OK, so that's _two_ questions, but you get the idea.) Let me know your feedback by speaking up in the comments below.
