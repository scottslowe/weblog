I just finished downloading the final release version of [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) from the VMware web site, and as I type this blog posting I'm in the process of updating the VMware Tools in my Windows XP Professional VM. Already in my limited testing of the new release I see improvements in Unity (the Windows background no longer shows up when you minimize a window). As I'm a bit limited on time right at the moment (in the midst of a VMware deployment, imagine that!), I'll stop there, and I'll post more thoughts about the final version later today.

Let me reiterate again that my hat is off to VMware and the Fusion product team. Great work!
