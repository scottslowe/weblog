Next Monday, May 20, the [OpenStack Denver meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Denver/) will gather jointly with the inaugural meeting of the [Infracoders Denver meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Infracoders-Denver/) for a talk titled "Infrastructure as Code with Chef and OpenStack." The joint meeting will be held at Innovation Pavilion in Centennial/Englewood (location information [here](http://ipcentennial.com/our-location/)). The event will start at 7PM.

Giving the presentation will be none other than Joshua Timberman of [OpsCode](http://www.opscode.com/) ([@jtimberman](http://twitter.com/jtimberman/) on Twitter). Joshua will be speaking on Chef, a system integration framework that is commonly used in "infrastructure as code" environments and in a number of OpenStack deployments. Joshua will discuss the basic principles of Chef, the primitives it provides, and how you can use it to drive your infrastructure toward full automation.

For more information, or to RSVP for the meetup event, you can visit either the [OpenStack Denver meetup group event page](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Denver/events/118387222/) or the [Infracoders Denver meetup group event page](http://www.meetup.com/Infracoders-Denver/events/118388152/). We do ask that you RSVP so that we can plan food and drinks for the event, but please only RSVP in one of the two meetup groups (not both).

&lt;aside&gt;Also, if you are interested in presenting at the OpenStack Denver meetup group or the Infracoders Denver meetup group, please let me know. We are actively seeking co-organizers as well as speakers/presenters for future events.&lt;/aside&gt;

If you live in the South Denver metro area and are interested in either OpenStack or infrastructure as code, this is an event you won't want to miss!
