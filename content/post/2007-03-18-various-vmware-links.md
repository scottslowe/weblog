I think I've mentioned before that I use [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire) for subscribing to various RSS and Atom feeds for various topics. Of course, given my interest in virtualization, [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) and VMware-related tags are things that are included in my feed list, and quite often I come across a link from a tag search or [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) subscription that I find interesting. It may not justify a dedicated blog post about that particular item, though, because it may not be anything about which I can contribute useful information. After all, there's enough useless junk floating around the Internet as it is; why should I contribute to the problem?

Likewise, I typically won't post a link to [my del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/slowe/) unless it's something that I know I'll need to reference again, and these tidbits of information sometimes aren't useful reference articles. So, instead of blogging about these or just posting them to del.icio.us, I thought I'd post the links here. It seems like a reasonable compromise between the two, if you ask me.

* [VMware: new patches available for ESX 3.0.1](http://virtrix.blogspot.com/2007/03/vmware-new-patches-available-for-esx.html)

* [Getting VMFS datastore information with PowerShell](http://pshell.info/?p=158)

There you go. Enjoy!
