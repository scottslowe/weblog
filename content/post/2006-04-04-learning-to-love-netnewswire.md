When I upgraded to [Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger"][1] a few weeks ago, I gave up my existing RSS reader ([PulpFiction](http://freshsqueeze.com/products/pulpfiction/)) in search of a new application (this was at the same time I had to [rebuild my list of RSS subscriptions][2]). Having finally settled on [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), I'm now learning to love the application that at first irritated me.

When I first tried NetNewsWire shortly after switching to the Mac, I just didn't like it. At the time, the thing that irritated me most was the fact that headlines disappeared after a while. (I now know that's "normal.") When I discovered PulpFiction and its persistence model, it seemed like a perfect fit. The built-in [Growl](http://www.growl.info/) integration, support for [AppleScript](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/), and filtering functionality were natural extensions. After a while, though, I found myself dreading to check headlines, and struggling to maintain what I thought were "reasonable" lists of headlines to be retained for future reference. Having to _process_ every single headline---delete it, file it, e-mail it, write about it, etc.---was just too time-consuming. Heck, I couldn't even keep up with my e-mail inbox, much less my RSS inbox.

When I decided to switch RSS aggregators during the Tiger upgrade, the idea of persistence was no longer a plus for me. NetNewsWire's model (and the model shared by many other RSS aggregators) was now appealing to me, instead of irritating. Even so, it wasn't love at first use; I was initially bothered by the lack of filters and built-in Growl integration.

As I soon discovered, though, the Growl integration was easily solved using [NewsGrowl](http://fever606.distantblue.net/code/), and that in itself underscored a feature of NetNewsWire that I have yet to fully explore---script subscriptions. And filters were proven to be unnecessary due to the lack of persistence in the headlines. While I didn't get [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/) support (i.e., the ability to search headlines using Spotlight), I did get AppleScript support and [Automator](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/) support.

In addition, it's the little features that have really started to grow on me (note that some of these features are only in the latest beta version). Notably:

* The right-click menu includes commands not only to copy the URL, but to also copy the headline itself---very handy for my typical workflow.

* NetNewsWire has a "Post to del.icio.us" command that works with [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/), instead of forcing me to post via a browser. (Of course, it also integrates with [ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/), my blogging client, for posting to this weblog.)

* Selective persistence, via flagging articles, allows me to choose which headlines (if any), I'd like to hang onto for a bit longer.

I'm confident that as I continue to use NetNewsWire, I'll find more "nuggets of usefulness" built into the application. If you're looking for a good Mac OS X RSS aggregator, you would be well-served to give NetNewsWire a serious look.
