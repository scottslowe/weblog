As I make my push deeper into [VMware ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/esx/) and [VirtualCenter](http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/), I'm hoping to get a chance to try out [Reflex VSA](http://www.reflexsecurity.com/products/reflexvsa.php) as well. Reflex VSA is, according to the vendor, a _virtual security product_ (emphasis mine).

The excellent [virtualization.info](http://www.virtualization.info/) blog [tipped me off to the press release](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/03/reflex-security-blazes-new-trail-with.html) announcing Reflex VSA. The idea here is to provide security services---such as firewalling, intrusion detection/prevention, and threat detection---within the virtual networking environment created by ESX Server. This would make it possible, for example, to create firewalls between different virtual switches within a single ESX Server host machine. The picture on the product information page for Reflex VSA really says it better than words can describe.

Is this type of product really needed? I don't know---that's a valid question. Once I get ESX Server up and running at the office, I plan to request a trial copy of Reflex VSA and see what it really does and how it really works. I'll post more information here once it's available.
