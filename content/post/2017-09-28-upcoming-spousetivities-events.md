Long-time readers/followers know that my wife, Crystal, runs a program called [Spousetivities][link-1]. This program organizes events for spouses/partners/significant others at IT industry conferences. This fall is a particularly busy season for Crystal and Spousetivities, as she'll be organizing events at DockerCon EU, the fall OpenStack Summit, and AWS re:Invent! Here are some details on these upcoming events.<!--more-->

## DockerCon EU 2017

For the first time, Spousetivities will be present at [DockerCon EU][link-2], taking place this year in Copenhagen, Denmark. There's a great set of activities planned:

* City tour of Copenhagen
* Castle tour, including Kronborg and Frederiksborg
* Food tour and Tivoli Gardens

More information is available [on the Spousetivities web site][link-4]; if you'd like to register for any of the events, [tickets are available right now][link-3].

## OpenStack Summit Sydney

Spousetivities returns to the fall OpenStack Summit, held this year in beautiful Sydney, Australia. Spousetivities is no stranger to the OpenStack Summits, having supported the OpenStack community for several years now.

Once again, Crystal has arranged a great set of activities in and around Sydney:

* Picturesque tour up to the Blue Mountains
* City tour of Sydney, including some beautiful hidden beaches
* Hunter Valley wine tour

[This blog post][link-6] on the Spousetivities site has more details about the activities. Registration is [open right now][link-5], so register early (before events sell out!).

## AWS re:Invent

Spousetivities will also be back at [AWS re:Invent][link-7] in Las Vegas. The exact list of activities hasn't yet been finalized, but if the events organized for VMworld are any indication (helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, anyone?), there's bound to be some great events. Stay tuned to the Spousetivities site (and this site) for more details as they are available.

## Sponsored by VMware NSX

All these activities are being sponsored by [VMware NSX][link-8]. Their sponsorship makes it possible for Crystal to cover her own travel and expenses and to subsidize the cost of the customized private tours that have been arranged for participants. If you're a conference attendee at one of these events whose spouse/partner/significant other will be able to travel with you because of Spousetivities, please let VMware NSX know how much you appreciate their support!
